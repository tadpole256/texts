  Alright this is another in my Quick & Dirty series, this one details
  how  to get the AWSOME Internet communications package, NetPhone, 
  absolutley phree! This is also an addendum for those of you who may have
  tried the Shark and SN Generator NetPhone kracks only to get a message 
  that 'This serial number is already in use.'

 NETPHONE 1.2.x

  For those of you who don't know, NetPhone is a Software  package from
  Electric Image which allows you to make VOICE phone calls to other 
  NetPhone users, over the Internet. All that's required is a MAC, a MODEM,
  and a MICROPHONE...and of course all parties must be using the NetPhone 
  software package.

  Now the NetPhone Software Package, currently at release v1.2.3, is 
  available in it's DEMO form from the Electric Magic Home Page. 
  But since we all know DEMOs suck we're going to explore how we can
  get the Full Package absolutley....

 PHREE!

  1. Use NetScape or other graphical Web Browser and goto:

             http://netpub.emagic.com/

     Download the NetPhone Demo. Once you've decompressed it, it's ready 
     for use. The only problem is the DEMO only allows 90 second long  
     conversations, and only for a limited number of times. To get longer 
     conversations you need to purchase a Registration Number.....unless, 
     of course you know how to circumvent such incoveniences. To do this
     we need to modify NetPhone to allow us to enter ANY registration code 
     (i.e. 0u812). Here's the patch:
 
             ====================================================
     *NOTE*: If you have either the NetPhone Serial# Generator
             or Shark's NetPhone [K]rackyou DO NOT have to make
             the following Hard Krack. YOU DO however have to go 
             to Step 3. Otherwise the Shark or SN Gen Kracks will 
             only work for a day or so if that.
             ====================================================

     a. Load ResEdit 2.x. Open NetPhone and then double-click on the CODE 
        resource. With in the CODE open 'MAIN'.  Make the following 
        modifications:

                       OFFSET = $025A86  from: 66 42
                                           to: 60 42

                       OFFSET = $0288F2  from: 67 04
                                           to: 60 04
 
                       OFFSET = $0288FE  from: 66 08
                                           to: 4E 71

                       OFFSET = $028906  from: 67 04
                                           to: 60 04

                       OFFSET = $028964  from: 66 06
                                           to: 4E 71

                       OFFSET = $02896A  from: 67 04
                                           to: 60 04
           

  2. Now, with the above modification we can enter ANYTHING as the 
     registration code. But now the only problem is that NetPhone, when 
     connected to a network, makes an initial check with the Electric Image 
     company server (at log.tpc.emagic.com) to make sure that the code that
     is entered is registered with Electric Magic (since they are the only 
     ones who are supposed to issue codes), and also to make sure no 
     DUPLICATE codes are in use at the same time. Since E-Magic did not 
     issue our code (and it's therefore not registered), we need to defeat 
     the registration check NetPhone makes with the company server.

     a. Load Norton Disk Editor. Open NetPhone 1.2.3Ý.

     b. Goto the DATA FORK. Make the following FIND and REPLACE:

              FIND: 6C 6F 67 2E 74 70 63 2E 65 6D 61 67 69 63 2E 63 6F 6D
        REPLACE w/: 6F 6C 65 42 75 7A 7A 61 72 64 27 73 20 3C 6B 30 70 3E

     b. Goto the RESOURCE FORK, and make the following FIND and REPLACE:

              FIND: 6C 6F 67 2E 74 70 63 2E 65 6D 61 67 69 63 2E 63 6F 6D
        REPLACE w/: 6F 6C 65 42 75 7A 7A 61 72 64 27 73 20 3C 6B 30 70 3E

     d. You're done.

 OUTRO

  That's it! Now go make Free Long Distance phone calls, with your free
  NetPhone Software Package (a US$59.95+tax value). Look for other fine
  philes from oleBuzzard at.....
