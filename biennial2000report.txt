I. OVERVIEW
1. This Staff Report summarizes the findings of an extensive review of the Federal 
Communications Commission's rules.  Each Bureau and Office reviewed the rules pertinent to its 
operations to determine whether to recommend that the Commission modify or eliminate any 
rules.  Accompanying this written report is a rule part analysis that identifies the Commission's 
rule parts, explains the purpose, benefits and disadvantages of the particular rule or rule part, and 
lists any staff recommendation for modifying or repealing any rules within each part.  The report 
and analysis are steps in the Commission's process of conducting biennial regulatory reviews 
pursuant to section 11 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), 
and section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act).   These documents are 
staff recommendations, and do not reflect formal Commission opinions or binding 
determinations.  
II. BACKGROUND
A. Legal Authority
2. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended "to promote 
competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for 
American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new 
telecommunications technologies."   The 1996 Act significantly amended the Communications 
Act of 1934 to permit and encourage competition in various communications markets.  Congress 
anticipated that, as competition developed, market forces would reduce the need for regulation.   
Therefore, in addition to requiring the Commission to take certain actions to open markets to 
competition, Congress required the Commission to review certain of its regulations every two 
years and to modify or repeal those regulations that are no longer "necessary in the public 
interest."   
3. Section 11 of the Communications Act, which was added by the 1996 Act, 
provides:
(a) Biennial Review of Regulations. - In every even-numbered year (beginning with 
1998), the Commission -
(1) shall review all regulations issued under this Act in effect at the time of the 
review that apply to the operations or activities of any provider of 
telecommunications service; and
(2) shall determine whether any such regulation is no longer necessary in the 
public interest as the result of meaningful economic competition between 
providers of such service.
(b) Effect of Determination. - The Commission shall repeal or modify any regulation it 
determines to be no longer necessary in the public interest.

4. Section 202 of the 1996 Act addresses matters regarding broadcast ownership.  
Section 202(h) provides:
The Commission shall review its rules adopted pursuant to this 
section and all of its ownership rules biennially as part of its 
regulatory reform review under section 11 of the 
Communications Act of 1934 and shall determine whether any 
of such rules are necessary in the public interest as the result of 
competition.  The Commission shall repeal or modify any 
regulation it determines to be no longer in the public interest. 
5. Section 11 and section 202(h), collectively, require the Commission:  (1) to 
review biennially its regulations that pertain to (a) the operations or activities of 
telecommunications service providers,  and (b) broadcast ownership; and (2) to determine 
whether those regulations are no longer necessary in the public interest as a result of meaningful 
economic competition.  Following such review, the Commission is directed to modify or repeal 
any such regulations that are no longer necessary in the public interest.  
6. In addition to these statutory requirements, the Commission has discretion to 
suspend, modify, revoke or waive any of its regulations for good cause, pursuant to other 
applicable requirements, such as the Administrative Procedure Act.   Thus, for example, the 
Commission may consider whether circumstances other than economic competition justify 
modification or repeal of particular rules. 
B. Summary of 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review 
7. In 1998, the Commission reviewed all of its regulations.  The Commission did 
not attempt to identify or limit its review to rules that "apply to the operations or activities" of 
telecommunications service providers.   For the 1998 review:  (1) each of the operating bureaus 
and the Office of Engineering and Technology conducted a review of the rules under their 
jurisdiction; and (2) members of the Office of Plans and Policy, the Chief Economist and his 
staff, and members of the Competition Division in the Office of General Counsel conducted a 
parallel review of Commission rules.  These reviews were not limited to whether "meaningful 
economic competition" justified changes, but instead considered whether, for any reason, 
modification or elimination of a rule would serve the public interest. 
8. The team from the Office of Plans and Policy/Chief Economist/Competition 
Division used the following questions in its review:
Is the original or present purpose of the regulation still valid? 
If a valid purpose for the regulation exists, how well does the regulation achieve the 
purpose?
Even if a regulation achieves its purpose, do the burdens it creates outweigh its 
advantages? 
Is there a less burdensome alternative that will produce similar benefits?
Does the regulation overlap, interfere, or conflict with other regulations such that 
modification is warranted?

9. The Commission received substantial public input.  For example, each of the 
Bureaus, together with the Office of General Counsel, hosted a series of public fora to solicit 
ideas regarding rules that might warrant repeal or modification.  In addition, staff received input 
during a series of meetings held by practice groups of the Federal Communications Bar 
Association. 
10. The 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review led to the initiation of a wide range of 
deregulatory and streamlining proposals.   For example, the Commission initiated 32 proceedings 
and modified or eliminated hundreds of rules, particularly ones that affected the operations and 
activities of telecommunications service providers. 
III. THE 2000 BIENNIAL REGULATORY REVIEW 
11. This review attempts to build upon the work completed in the 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review, and to establish a foundation for future reviews.  In particular, the 2000 
Biennial Regulatory Review provides greater documentation of the staff's review.  The review 
process is incremental, however, and staff expects that even greater documentation will occur in 
future years.  In addition, staff recommends that the Commission consider setting forth an 
analysis similar to the analysis used in this staff report whenever the Commission adopts new 
rules.  Such an analysis may include the reason for the rule, whether the rule effectively 
accomplishes its intended purpose, and the status of competition at the time the rule is enacted.  
Conducting such an analysis at the time new rules are adopted might help ensure that new 
regulatory requirements are carefully tailored to achieve their intended regulatory goals.  Such 
analysis might also significantly reduce the burdens associated with future biennial reviews.
12. In evaluating the rules, staff applied a consistent analysis to determine whether to 
recommend modification or elimination of Commission rules.  Staff's review considered (1) the 
purpose of the rule; (2) the advantages of the rule;  (3) the disadvantages of the rule;  (4) what 
impact competitive developments have had on the rule; and (5) whether to recommend 
modification or revocation of the rule.  This analysis allowed the staff to make reasoned 
determinations about whether a rule should be changed or eliminated either because of 
competitive developments, or for other reasons.  For example, staff considered whether the 
underlying purpose of the rule is still relevant, and, if so, whether that purpose could be 
accomplished more effectively in another manner.  
13. Although there may be other ways to determine whether a Commission rule 
continues to be necessary in the public interest, staff believes that the analysis it used is a 
reasonable way to carry out the requirements of section 11 and section 202(h).  In addition, the 
analysis staff used is relatively easy to apply, and permits consideration of all relevant factors in 
determining whether a rule should be modified or revoked.  Staff therefore recommends that the 
Commission adopt this analysis when it makes public interest determinations.
A. Method and Scope of Review
14. The Commission has devoted substantial time and resources to the 2000 Biennial 
Regulatory Review.  In the fall of 1999, Commission staff began to create a computer database of 
Commission rules.  In early 2000, a team consisting of representatives from each Bureau and 
Office began to develop a method for conducting the staff review.  The team agreed to a 
framework and analysis that each Bureau and Office would use in reviewing its rules.  This 
framework was intended to ensure a well-reasoned and consistent review across the agency.  That 
framework included the following:
a.) Each Bureau and Office would endeavor to look at all of its 
rules - not only rules that are specifically implicated by sections 
11 and 202(h) - and consider whether repeal or modification 
might be appropriate.
The benefits associated with modifying or eliminating regulations are not limited to the rules 
implicated in sections 11 and 202(h).  The team determined that a broad review of Commission 
rules, even beyond the scope of statutory requirements, could provide significant benefits.  The 
team reasoned, for example, that eliminating unnecessary regulations would likely reduce 
compliance costs of service providers, which in turn could reduce charges to consumers.  
Similarly, the team deemed it reasonable to consider whether any regulations could be modified 
so that they achieve their intended goals more effectively or in a less burdensome manner.  In 
addition, the team determined that its decision to conduct a broad rule review would reduce the 
potential for disagreement about what rules are subject to the mandatory review requirements in 
sections 11 and 202(h).  
b.) As noted above, the team determined that each Bureau and 
Office would use a consistent analysis, which would consider the 
advantages and disadvantages of the existing rules and what 
impact, if any, competitive developments have had on each rule.  
Each Bureau and Office would consider whether revocation or 
modification might be appropriate for any reason.  The review 
would not be limited to whether changes were warranted as a 
result of economic competition.  
Although sections 11 and 202(h) require the Commission to determine whether rules remain 
necessary in the public interest as a result of competition, the team determined that there might be 
other relevant bases for modifying or revoking a rule.  For example, a rule might be obsolete as a 
result of technological developments.  Or modification might be appropriate as a result of 
changes in industry practices or judicial decisions, or because a rule is duplicative of or 
contradictory to other rules.  Although the Commission has worked hard to keep its rules current 
with industry, judicial, and other developments, the biennial regulatory review process provides 
another opportunity to ensure that the Commission's rules are up-to-date.  
15. The team also recognized that, even where competition develops, it will not 
always and immediately eliminate the need for regulation.  For example, there may be certain 
segments of the market that would not receive service of acceptable quality or at affordable rates 
absent regulation.  Thus, even if a regulation generally is no longer necessary in the public 
interest as a result of competition, there may be reasons to retain it, at least with respect to certain 
segments of the market.  
c.) Staff would prepare a report that summarizes the review 
conducted by each Bureau and Office.  In addition, staff would 
provide a written description of the analysis used in reviewing 
each rule part implicated by sections 11 or 202(h). 
The staff report includes highlights of the staff's review, as well as recommendations for 
Commission action.  The staff report is not limited to rules that are subject to the biennial 
regulatory review requirements of sections 11 and 202(h).
16. The rule part analysis provides additional documentation of the staff's review of 
each rule part that is implicated by section 11 or section 202(h).  It is intended to enable the 
public to understand the reasoning behind the staff's review and recommendation.  The analysis 
strives to encompass any rule that might affect the operations or activities of telecommunications 
service providers.
17. The team recognized that completing a comprehensive rule review, as it 
proposed, would be time-consuming and labor intensive.  The team concluded that it should give 
priority to satisfying statutory requirements, and thus would focus its efforts on completing the 
rule analysis for rules that are implicated by sections 11 and 202(h).
18. The analysis generally documents review by rule part, but it identifies many of 
the individual rules that the staff recommends be modified or repealed.  Staff determined that in 
most instances, providing analysis at the rule part level was sufficient to identify the reasoning 
used and the basis for the recommendations.  In some instances, however, staff determined that it 
should include its analysis of rule subparts.  For example, where only portions of the rule part are 
implicated by section 11, or where more than one Bureau or Office shares responsibility for 
overseeing a rule part, the analysis may be done by subpart.  
B. Analytical Framework 
19. The analytical framework that staff used for this Biennial Regulatory Review 
recognizes that significant economic benefits can be achieved by fostering competition.  
Although regulation may sometimes be necessary to correct market failures or prevent the accrual 
of excessive market power,  in most instances market forces will yield economically efficient 
results.  Staff's review thus sought to maximize the potential for self-correcting market action, 
and to suggest deregulatory action warranted by economic and technological developments.  Staff 
considered factors such as the effect a rule has on competitive entry into specific services, 
whether the rule encourages resource-efficient technologies, the effect of the rule on costs for the 
industry and the agency, and whether developments in the definition and structure of the relevant 
market would suggest that the elimination or modification of the rule is appropriate.  Staff paid 
particular attention to rules that seek to limit the exercise of market power in markets 
transitioning to a more competitive structure.  
20. The staff also recognized that some of the Commission's goals might require 
regulatory action even when developments like those mentioned above are taken into 
consideration.  For example, the Commission has sought to ensure that all Americans have access 
to the widest variety of telecommunications services and that audiences have access to diverse 
media sources.  Staff attempted to consider all of the Commission's stated policy concerns when 
it reviewed the agency's rules. 
C. Structure of the Staff Report
21. Staff endeavored to review all of the Commission's rules rather than limit its 
review to rules covered explicitly by section 11 of the Communications Act and section 202(h) of 
the 1996 Act.  Staff determined that a broad review of the Commission's rules could provide 
significant benefits, although it gave priority to the rules that are implicated in sections 11 and 
202(h).  
22. Each Bureau and Office conducted this review by seeking input from staff and 
industry groups.  In conducting this review, staff considered (1) the purpose of the rule; (2) the 
advantages of the rule; (3) the disadvantages of the rule; and (4) the impact competitive 
developments may have had on the need for the rule. 
23. This Report summarizes staff's review of the Commission's rules, the status of 
ongoing and recent initiatives, and recommendations on whether specific rules should be kept in 
place, modified, or repealed.  The staff's recommendations are also reported in the attached rule 
part analysis.  The rule part analysis summarizes staff's findings and should be viewed as works 
in progress.  The analysis does not reflect formal Commission opinions or binding 
determinations. 
24. Staff recommends that the Commission seek public comment on the Report and 
the rule part analysis.  
D. Further Action to Complete 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review
25. This Staff Report is merely one step in the Commission's 2000 Biennial 
Regulatory Review.  Section 11 and section 202(h) mandate Commission determinations.  Staff 
proposes that the Commission release and seek comment on the Staff Report and rule part 
analysis.  After receiving public comment, staff anticipates that the Commission would issue a 
report before December 31, 2000.  The Commission report would determine what if any 
regulations are no longer necessary in the public interest, in accordance with section 11 and 
section 202(h).
26. Pursuant to the Commission's determinations, staff expects that the Commission 
would initiate proceedings to modify or eliminate selected rules.  These proceedings would 
conform with Commission procedural rules and the Administrative Procedure Act.  Although 
some of these proceedings will be initiated in the year 2000, many will not be.  The statute does 
not require the Commission to repeal or modify its rules by the end of 2000.   


IV. SUMMARY OF REVIEWS BY COMMON CARRIER, INTERNATIONAL, AND 
WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAUS
A. Common Carrier Bureau
27. The Common Carrier Bureau advises the Commission regarding the regulation of 
telecommunications service providers, including issues related to interstate telecommunications 
service, interstate access service, and local exchange competition.  The Bureau administers rules 
and policies designed to foster competition in telecommunications markets, promote widespread 
availability of telecommunications, and protect consumers. 
28. The Common Carrier Bureau has focused in recent years on adopting market-
opening and universal service rules for the local exchange and long distance markets.  The 
Bureau has also focused on review of applications by Bell Operating Companies to provide long 
distance service as well as review of telecommunications company mergers.  In addition, the 
Bureau has devoted considerable resources to consideration of the regulatory reforms that should 
occur as competition in the provision of telecommunications services develops.  
29. In evaluating the state of competition, the Bureau has found that the long distance 
services market is competitive, but competition in the local exchange and exchange access 
markets is nascent.  While incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) and the new local exchange 
entrants disagree about the extent to which local competition has developed, competition for local 
exchange services has taken root and is increasing.
30. Three recent reports concerning competitive developments in the local exchange 
market conclude that competition is growing, although competitive local exchange carriers still 
serve only a very small portion of local exchange lines.  "Telecommunications @ the 
Millennium," a report by the FCC Office of Plans and Policy, states that "[o]n the fourth 
anniversary of the Act, we see competition in the local market beginning to take hold."   The 
report states that, "in 1996, when the Act was passed, competitors had a one percent share of the 
local market,"  adding that "[t]heir share of the local market has increased to 4 percent of lines 
served and over 6 percent of local service revenue."   The report states that "[l]ocal competitors 
have been particularly successful in the business market, where competitors have added 65 
percent of all new lines deployed in the third quarter of 1999."   The report adds that "more 
people are beginning to see wireless telephones as substitutes for their wireline services"  in light 
of dramatic price decreases and increases in service quality.  These trends are further explored in 
"Local Telephone Competition at the New Millennium," a report by the FCC Common Carrier 
Bureau.   A report by the United States General Accounting Office, "Development of 
Competition in Local Telephone Markets," states that, "[t]o date, little competition has emerged 
in local telephone markets,"  but concludes that "further competition seems likely to develop in 
local telephone markets."   The report notes that "competing carriers, . . . are using all entry 
modes envisioned by the act, legal and regulatory issues are . . . becoming clarified, and the 
packaging of varied telecommunications services may enable firms providing other 
telecommunications services to effectively compete for local telephone customers." 
31. In contrast to the market for local exchange and exchange access service, the 
markets for long distance and customer premises equipment (CPE) are competitive and have been 
increasingly deregulated.  Long distance prices (international and domestic), as approximated by 
average revenue per minute, have fallen by 34 percent since 1993.   Similarly, a vibrantly 
competitive market has developed for CPE, and, as a result, basic voice telephones are now 
available from an array of suppliers with a myriad of options at extremely low prices.   
32. It is against this background that we begin our second "Biennial Regulatory 
Review" of rules for common carriers.  
1. Scope of Review
33. As part of the review process, initiated by the Year 2000 Biennial Regulatory 
Review Working Group, the Common Carrier Bureau has reviewed all of the rules within each of 
the following parts that affect common carriers.
Part 32 - Uniform System of Accounts - Establishes mandatory minimum accounting 
standards for certain common carriers.  
Part 36 - Jurisdictional Separations - Contains an outline of the separations procedures 
designed primarily for the allocation of property costs, revenues, expenses, taxes and 
reserves between the state and interstate jurisdictions.
Part 42 - Record Retention Requirements - Prescribes the regulations governing the 
preservation of records of communications common carriers.  
Part 43 - Reporting Requirements - Prescribes specific filing requirements for 
communications common carriers and certain of their affiliates.
Part 51 - Interconnection - Establishes interconnection obligations for LECs.
Part 52 - Numbering - Establishes conditions for the administration and use of 
telecommunications numbers for provision of telecommunications services in the United 
States. 
Part 53 - Special Provisions Concerning Bell Operating Companies - Establishes special 
requirements applicable to the Bell Operating Companies, pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  271 
and 272.
Part 54 - Universal Service - Establishes the mechanisms to ensure the provision of 
Universal Service.
Part 59 - Infrastructure Sharing - Establishes the general duty of incumbent LECs to 
make available to certain qualifying carriers network infrastructure, facilities, functions, 
technology, and information.
Part 61 - Tariffs - Prescribes the framework for the initial establishment of and 
subsequent revisions to tariff publications for certain carriers. 
Part 63 - Extension of Lines - Prescribes a regulatory framework for construction of 
wireline common carrier infrastructure.
Part 64 - Miscellaneous - Addresses a broad range of common carrier issues. 
Part 65 - Rate of Return - Establishes procedures and methodologies for Commission 
prescription of an authorized unitary interstate exchange access rate of return and 
individual authorized rates of return for the interstate exchange access rates of certain 
other carriers. 
Part 68 - Connections of Terminal Equipment - Permits direct connection to the network 
of registered terminal equipment.  Provides uniform technical standards for equipment to 
prevent network harm and ensure that telephones are compatible with hearing aids. 
Part 69 - Access Charges - Establishes rules for access charges for interstate or foreign 
access services for incumbent LECs.

2. Recent and Ongoing Activities
34. Recently, the Commission has begun a number of proceedings designed to 
reduce or simplify wireline common carrier regulation in light of increasing local exchange 
competition and other industry developments.  Among other things, the Commission is currently 
conducting rulemaking proceedings to review: (1) Part 32 of the Rules, Uniform System of 
Accounts for Class A and B Telephone Companies, and the Commission's ARMIS (Automated 
Reporting Management Information System) information reporting system for incumbent LECs; 
(2) Part 36 of the Rules, Jurisdictional Separations; and (3) Part 68 of the Rules, Connection of 
Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network.  In addition, the Commission initiated several 
common carrier rulemakings as part of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review. 
a) Accounting and ARMIS Requirements
35. The Commission is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its Part 32 
accounting and related rules and its ARMIS reporting requirements.  This comprehensive review 
will complement the Biennial Regulatory Review process and ensure that the goal of continued 
deregulation is vigorously pursued.   This review will consider the need for various accounting 
and reporting requirements and whether they impose unnecessary burdens on incumbent LECs as 
local exchange competition develops.  Resolution of these issues could have a significant effect 
on State commissions because most of them rely on the FCC accounting and reporting 
requirements. 
36. The review is being conducted in two phases.  Phase 1, which was completed in 
March 2000, was designed to focus on immediate streamlining measures.   Phase 2 will 
"examine broader and more extensive deregulatory measures."   The Commission took the 
following specific steps to streamline its accounting requirements in Phase 1: (1) eliminated the 
expense matrix filing requirement; (2) allowed carriers to reduce the cost allocation manual 
(CAM) audit requirement from an annual financial statement audit to a biennial attestation 
engagement; (3) relaxed the affiliate transactions requirements for services; (4) eliminated the 15-
day pre-filing requirement for certain CAM changes; (5) eliminated the 30-day notification 
requirement for establishment of temporary or experimental accounts; (6) allowed carriers to 
record contingent liabilities without agency review; (7) eliminated the reclassification 
requirement for certain property held for future use; and (8) eliminated the reclassification 
requirement for certain plant under construction.    The Phase 1 Order also streamlined the 
ARMIS reporting requirements by, among other things, eliminating certain Tables, eliminating 
reporting items from a number of Tables, and establishing new threshold levels for certain 
reporting items.  
37. The Common Carrier Bureau conducted a number of public workshops this 
spring, including one workshop devoted solely to issues concerning mid-sized incumbent LECs, 
to solicit ideas on reform initiatives for Phase 2 of this proceeding.   These workshops have 
covered the Part 32 chart of accounts, the affiliate transaction rules and certain Part 64 rules, 
ARMIS financial reporting requirements, ARMIS non-financial reports, and other rules of 
concern to mid-sized carriers.  Interested parties have made numerous proposals for 
simplification of the Commission's accounting and reporting requirements in these workshops.  
The proposals discussed at the workshops include, among other things: (1) use of the simplified 
Class B accounting rules by all carriers; (2) elimination of various accounts and sub-accounts; (3) 
elimination of the requirement for agency approval to implement changes in Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); (4) 
more flexibility in dealing with construction costs; and (5) streamlining and eventual elimination 
of the ARMIS reporting requirements.  The Bureau recommends that the Commission adopt a 
Phase 2 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding.
b) Jurisdictional Separations 
38. The Commission has instituted a review of the Part 36 jurisdictional separations 
procedures, which govern the division of the carriers' regulated costs between the state and 
federal jurisdictions.   The costs allocated to the interstate jurisdiction by Part 36 are recovered 
through charges regulated by the FCC, and the costs allocated to the state jurisdiction are 
recovered through charges regulated by the states.
39. The Commission stated that the purpose of the Separations Reform Notice was to 
consider what changes to our separations procedures might be appropriate in light of legal, 
technological and market structure changes affecting telecommunications.  The Commission 
specifically requested comment on: (1) what changes in the law and within the industry may 
warrant revision of the separations process; (2) the criteria that should be used in evaluating the 
existing separations procedures and proposals for reform; (3) whether separations rules are 
needed during the transition to a competitive market; (4) a number of specific industry proposals 
for replacement of the existing separations procedures; and (5) how various options for 
separations reform would affect revenue requirements and prices.   
40. Pursuant to the requirements of section 410(c) of the 1996 Act, the Commission 
referred these issues to the Federal-State Joint Board established in the separations reform 
proceeding for the preparation of a recommended decision.   On July 21, 2000, the Joint Board 
recommended that the Commission freeze certain elements of the separations process, including 
the jurisdictional allocation factors, for five years while the Joint Board and the Commission 
continue to review issues regarding comprehensive separations reform. 
c) Part 68 Equipment Registration
41. Prior to the adoption of the Part 68 rules, in 1975, incumbent LECs generally 
prohibited direct connection of third party customer premises equipment (CPE) to their networks, 
thus maintaining an essential monopoly over the provision of CPE.    Under Part 68, the 
incumbent LECs must permit direct connection to the public switched telephone network of CPE 
that is certified as meeting certain technical standards, which are designed to prevent harm to the 
public switched network.   The Commission develops these technical standards, and plays a 
major role in ensuring product compliance with these requirements.   A vibrantly competitive 
market for the provision of CPE has developed, resulting in an enormous increase in the variety 
of CPE available to consumers and major price reductions. 
42. The Common Carrier Bureau held a series of public fora on Part 68 to address 
streamlining issues in July 1999.   Representatives of the incumbent LECs, competitive LECs, 
equipment manufacturers, industry associations, terminal equipment testing laboratories and a 
state consumer counsel participated.  Most of these participants agreed that: (1) the public interest 
requires that carrier networks be protected from harm; (2) the industry and consumers would 
benefit from a single uniform set of national technical standards; (3) Part 68 contains few, if any, 
unnecessary technical requirements; (4) the Commission should retain authority to ensure 
protection of the public switched network; and (5) the Commission's present functions of 
developing technical requirements, laboratory qualification, and equipment registration can be 
privatized in most respects.  
43. On May 22, 2000, the Commission released the Part 68 NPRM, which seeks 
comment on three possible options to streamline most elements of the process by which technical 
criteria are established for CPE.    These options include:  (1) choosing a "gatekeeper" Standards 
Development Organization (SDO); (2) relying on multiple Standards Organizations; and (3) 
incorporating into the Commission's rules by reference specific standards developed by national 
standards organizations.  
44. In the Part 68 NPRM, the Commission also proposed to streamline the 
registration process for CPE.  Currently, the Commission itself reviews applications and issues 
grants for such equipment.  The Commission proposed to cease this direct registration and asked 
for comments on one or a combination of the following options to privatize the registration 
process: (1) use Telecommunications Certification Bodies, which have just begun operations; (2) 
permit manufacturers to use a self-declaration of conformity process; or (3) permit manufacturers 
to use a verification process.  The last two procedures are in use in Part 15 radio equipment 
licensing. 
d) Universal Service Reform for Rural Carriers
45. The Commission has also taken steps to begin consideration of rural carrier 
universal service issues in consultation with the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service 
(Joint Board).  In 1997 the Joint Board created a Rural Task Force to study possible universal 
service reforms for rural telephone companies.  The Rural Task Force is due to submit a report 
with recommendations to the Joint Board by September 30, 2000.  The Joint Board will then 
make its recommendations to the Commission, on the basis of the Rural Task Force's report.
46. In addition, in 1999 the Common Carrier Bureau granted the request of nine rural 
companies and removed the individual caps placed on the rural companies' high-cost loop 
support as a condition for grant of a study area waiver.   On August 4, 2000, in response to 
requests from more than 25 additional rural telephone companies, the Bureau removed these caps 
for all affected rural telephone companies, effective January 1, 2000.   
3. New Initiatives
47. In addition to the recent and ongoing actions discussed above, the staff 
recommends that the Commission address various other issues.  These issues include intercarrier 
compensation, periodic review of the separate subsidiary requirement for independent telephone 
company provision of inter-exchange service, and eliminating outdated rules.  
a) Intercarrier Compensation 
48. The staff recommends that the Commission consider whether the various, 
sometimes conflicting, rules used for calculating intercarrier compensation for the origination and 
termination of traffic can be streamlined and harmonized.  At present, the transport and 
termination provisions in sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act and the Commission's 
implementing regulations in 47 C.F.R.  51.701-717 govern the way the incumbent LECs and 
competitive LECs (CLECs) compensate one another for call completion.  The Part 69 access 
charge rules generally govern the compensation that incumbent LECs receive for the use of their 
services in the origination and termination of interstate interexchange traffic.  Access charge 
structures, generally similar to that in Part 69 of the Commission rules and adopted by individual 
states, govern compensation for the origination and termination of intrastate interexchange traffic.  
Moreover, Information Service Provider (ISP) traffic is exempt from interstate access charges.  
Instead, ISPs generally pay incumbent LECs local exchange business rates for their connections 
to the LEC local network. 
49. Since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Commission has been 
adjusting incumbent LECs' access charges to reflect costs, which has resulted in price reductions 
totaling $6.4 billion.   The Commission most recently reduced access charges paid by long 
distance carriers by $3.2 billion.   This action continues to further the Commission's objective of 
developing a more economically rational approach to access charges while balancing various, and 
sometimes competing interests - including promotion of competition, deregulation, maintaining 
affordability for all and avoiding rate-shock for consumers. 
50. The staff recommends that the Commission seek comment on a broad range of 
economic, legal and policy issues raised by the current system of intercarrier compensation for 
the origination and termination of traffic, and seek to identify alternative approaches that are 
more consistent with the long term development of competition.   One purpose of such a 
proceeding would be to explore whether a single consistent approach to intercarrier compensation 
for traffic origination and termination could be developed.  Staff believes that an appropriate, 
consolidated set of rules could reduce opportunities for arbitrage, eliminate incentives for 
inefficient market entry strategies, and reduce transaction costs.  The staff further recommends 
that the Commission evaluate alternative compensation mechanisms in terms of their effect on 
local exchange, exchange access, and interstate interexchange competition.  This proceeding 
should also consider the need for transitional mechanisms to ease the implementation of a new 
approach to intercarrier compensation for traffic origination and termination, and to avoid 
dislocations. 
b) Independent Incumbent LEC
51. The staff also recommends that the Commission modify Part 64, subpart T to 
provide for triennial review of the requirement that independent incumbent LECs provide 
interexchange service through a separate subsidiary.  Staff believes that such a review is 
necessary to insure that these separate affiliate requirements are eliminated when they no longer 
serve the public interest. 
c) Eliminating Outdated Rules 
52. The staff recommends that the Commission remove portions of the rules that are 
outdated.  For example, in the Part 69 Access Charge rules, as well as elsewhere, rules 
establishing a transition period may remain in place even after the transition has been completed.  
The provisions listed below, are examples of rules that should be eliminated, in whole or in part, 
for this reason.
36.701 - Lifeline connection assistance expense allocation - general.
51.211 - Toll Dialing Parity Implementation.
51.515(b)-(c) - Application of access charges.
53.101 - Joint marketing of local and long distance services by interLATA carriers.
53.201(a)-(b) - Services for which a separate 272 affiliate is required.
54.701(b)-(e) - Administrator of universal service support mechanisms.
64.1320 - Payphone compensation verification and reports.
64.1903(c) - Obligations of all incumbent independent local exchange carriers.
69.116 - Universal service fund.
69.117 - Lifeline assistance.
69.126 - Nonrecurring charges.
69.127 - Transitional equal charge rule.
69.612 - Long term and transitional support.
4. Other Issues
a) The USTA Petition and Industry Comments
53. In preparation for this Report, the staff has met with interested parties to discuss 
common carrier issues, including the United States Telephone Association (USTA), Competitive 
Telecommunications Association (CompTel), the Organization for the Promotion and 
Advancement of Small Telecommunications Companies (OPASTCO), National Telephone 
Cooperative Association (NTCA), the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA), 
Association for Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS) and Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association (CTIA).  We have also considered the Petition for Rulemaking filed by 
USTA in August 1999 addressing 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review issues, and the comments 
filed in response to it.   The ongoing proceedings and proposed initiatives discussed above 
address many but not all of the major common carrier concerns expressed by USTA.  For 
example, USTA sought numerous additional changes to Part 36 (concerning jurisdictional 
separations), to Part 32 (governing the Uniform System of Accounts), and to the ARMIS 
reporting requirements.  As discussed above, these matters are being, or will be, addressed by the 
Commission.  USTA also proposed rule changes to Parts 61 and 69.  These proposals generally 
would reorganize and streamline these parts by creating separate rule parts to govern tariff filings, 
rate-of-return LEC pricing , and price cap LEC pricing.  USTA also proposed substantially 
greater pricing flexibility for incumbent LEC access charges..  The staff does not recommend that 
the Commission initiate specific new proceedings at this time to address these Part 61 and 69 
concerns raised by USTA in the context of this biennial regulatory review.  First, many of these 
issues have been addressed.  For example, issues related to price cap LECs were considered in the 
Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Services (CALLS) proceeding and other 
proceedings addressing pricing flexibility.   In addition, many of the rate-of-return LEC access 
reform and pricing flexibility issues raised by USTA are the subject of pending proceedings or 
are scheduled for consideration.  
54. OPASTCO, NTCA and NECA also raised a number of specific issues for 
consideration in the context of the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review.  These issues include (1) 
streamlining accounting, jurisdictional separations and other cost allocation requirements; (2) 
universal service funding caps; (3) compensation for local number portability services and 
directory listing information; (4) establishment of a small telecom company federal advisory 
committee; (5) requirements affecting customer data and billing; (6) avoidance of unnecessary 
data reporting requirements; (7) average cost schedule review and reporting requirements; (8) 
elimination of the requirement for annual NECA elections; and (9) implementation of 
government mandates such as CALEA.  The staff recognizes the importance of these issues given 
the unique circumstances of small telephone companies and the customers they serve.  
Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission redouble its efforts to ensure appropriate 
accommodations for small telephone companies.  Many of the specific issues raised by 
OPASTCO and NTCA are currently under consideration by the Commission or are scheduled for 
consideration.  We also recommend that the Commission consider simplifying review of the 
average schedules and changing the schedule for NECA Board elections.  In addition, we note 
that the Commission will have the opportunity to consider lifting the cap on universal service 
funding for small companies in the context of the ongoing rural carrier universal service 
proceeding.  We do not recommend that the Commission initiate a new broad based proceeding 
focused on small telephone company concerns as part of this Biennial Regulatory Review since 
we believe that such issues can be addressed most expeditiously in other contexts.  Similarly, we 
are reluctant to recommend that the Commission establish a small telecom federal advisory 
committee, as we believe that this would lead to unnecessary complications and delays in 
addressing small telephone company concerns.  These parties are free, however, to petition for 
specific rulemakings or to file comments in response to this report.
B. International Bureau
55. The International Bureau administers policy for the authorization and regulation 
of international telecommunications facilities and services, as well as policy for licensing and 
regulating satellite facilities and services.  The Bureau represents the Commission in international 
fora, as well as in bilateral and multilateral meetings.   The Bureau directs and coordinates 
negotiations with Mexico, Canada and other countries regarding spectrum use and interference 
protection.  The Bureau provides assistance in telecommunications trade negotiations, and 
provides regulatory assistance and training programs to foreign governments.  
56. The International Bureau seeks to facilitate the introduction of new services, and 
to provide customers with more choices, more innovative services, and competitive prices.  The 
2000 Biennial Regulatory Review complements the Bureau's streamlining efforts.  The Bureau 
has taken a proactive approach in its rulemakings to remove unnecessary regulatory constraints, 
wherever possible and practicable.  It continually reviews its rules and policies to respond to 
changing conditions and developments in the industry.
1. Scope of Review
57. The International Bureau reviewed all of the rules that it administers.  
Specifically, the Bureau reviewed:
Part 1 - Practice and Procedure - In addition to procedural rules of general applicability to all 
Commission licensees, certain rules within Part 1 explicitly address international 
telecommunications service providers.
Part 23 - International Fixed Public Radio Communication Services - Contains rules 
applicable to international terrestrial fixed communications systems, including general 
licensing and application filing requirements, technical standards, and operations.
Part 25 - Satellite Communications - Contains rules applicable to satellite communications, 
including general licensing and application filing requirements, technical standards, and  
operations.
Part 43 - Reports of Communication Common Carriers and Certain Affiliates - Contains 
rules requiring certain reports by common carriers, including reports regarding different 
facets of international telecommunications.
Part 63 - Extension of Lines, and Discontinuance, Reduction, Outage and Impairment of 
Service by Common Carriers; and Grants of Recognized Private Operating Agency Status - 
Contains rules applicable to common carriers, including application filing requirements for 
international section 214 authorizations.
Part 64 - Miscellaneous Rules Relating to Common Carriers - Subpart J contains rules 
regarding the Commission's settlements policy.
Part 73 - Radio Broadcast Services - Subpart F contains rules applicable to international 
broadcast stations. 
Part 100 - Direct Broadcast Satellite Service - Contains rules applicable to direct broadcast 
satellite service, including technical and operating requirements.
2. Recent and Ongoing Activities
a) Satellite Licensing 
58. Part 25 and Part 100 of the Commission's rules form the basis for the 
Commission's "Open Skies" policy under which a wide range of systems has been licensed to 
provide satellite services.    Through this policy, the Bureau attempts to accommodate the 
maximum number of systems possible to provide a particular service in order to maximize entry 
and competition in the satellite service market. 
(1) Space Segment Authorization
59. The Commission has already taken steps to streamline the space segment portion 
of the satellite licensing process.  First, the Commission eliminated section 319(d) waiver 
procedures to permit companies to begin construction, at their own risk, prior to being licensed.   
Second, the Commission relaxed the rules governing space station licensee reports.  Third, 
DISCO I eliminated the distinction between U.S.-licensed domestic satellites and international 
"separate" satellite systems, and the new rules allow satellites to provide both domestic and 
international services.   Fourth, DISCO II adopted a framework to evaluate requests by foreign 
satellite operators to provide service in the United States.   DISCO II also established the 
"Permitted" List, which provides another option to non-U.S. satellite operators under which, once 
placed on the "Permitted Space Station" list, the non-U.S. satellites could provide fixed-satellite 
service in the United States. 
60. In the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) context, the Commission issued an NPRM, 
which proposes to consolidate and harmonize the Commission's Satellite rules and eliminate the 
Commission's separate Part 100 rules for DBS and incorporate the rules into Part 25. 
(2) International Satellite Coordination
61. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a satellite 
coordination process to facilitate the harmonious use of satellite orbits and spectrum among 
Administrations.   Satellite coordination occurs by negotiating mutually satisfactory solutions 
among the affected parties.  All space segment licenses that the Commission issues must comply 
with ITU coordination requirements and international agreements.  To eliminate delay of pending 
international coordination, however, the Commission moves forward with space segment 
applications and typically approves them before coordination is complete.  All authorizations are 
subject to possible changes that may be necessary to conform to final coordination agreements.  
This approach saves satellite applicants substantial time.  In addition, the Commission has 
developed processes that allow U.S. satellite operators to negotiate directly with satellite 
operators of other countries.  The Commission reviews and finalizes any operator arrangements 
before agreeing to them.  This process saves staff resources and permits the satellite operators to 
have some decisional role in the authorization process.  
62. The staff and the industry also are working together to propose solutions to the 
backlog of coordination filings at the ITU.  There is a need to reduce the time it takes for the ITU 
to process a coordination request because it has a direct effect on the international coordination 
process and on our licensing process.
(3) Earth Station Licensing  
63. Earth stations are licensed generally for 10 years.  The Commission also issues a 
single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations (e.g., very small 
aperture terminal earth stations (VSATs), and Satellite News Gathering and mobile earth 
stations).  Less than a year ago, the International Bureau streamlined its processing of certain 
earth station applications.  Specifically, the Bureau instituted an "auto-grant" process that 
automatically grants routine satellite earth station applications proposing to use the Ku-band 
fixed-satellite service frequencies (14.0-14.5 GHz / 11.7-12.2 GHz) to communicate with all 
satellites authorized to provide service to the United States (the "Permitted List").   Such routine 
earth station applications are considered granted 35 days from the date on which the application 
appears on public notice as "accepted for filing," provided that no objections are filed during the 
public comment period.  These changes were consistent with the increased competition and 
consumer demand in the satellite marketplace.  
64. The Bureau also reduced the number of emission designators required to be 
identified in applications for digital systems.   This modification significantly reduces the time 
necessary to enter earth station information into the Commission's database, and largely 
eliminates the need for earth station operators to file modification applications when they wish to 
add a new emission.  
65. The Commission also modified its Part 25 rules to provide earth station 
applicants greater flexibility.   For example, the Commission simplified rules for license 
renewals for temporary fixed earth stations and very small aperture terminal earth stations 
(VSATs).  The Commission extended the licensing term for VSATs to 10 years.  Additionally, 
the Bureau created new procedures to allow Special Temporary Authority to be granted readily 
for use by satellite earth stations if the applicant is able to demonstrate extraordinary 
circumstances, according to Part 25.  Furthermore, the Bureau issued a Public Notice that 
committed to placing routine applications on public notice within 10 business days of receipt by 
the Bureau, provided the application includes all required information.  
b) Section 214 Applications
66. The Commission has taken great strides to streamline its international 214 
application processes.  In 1996, the Commission created an expedited process for global, 
facilities-based section 214 applications.   The Commission created global section 214 
authorizations, reduced paperwork obligations, streamlined tariff requirements for non-dominant 
international carriers, and ensured that essential information is readily available to all carriers and 
users.  The new regulations facilitated entry into the international telecommunications market and 
the expansion of international services. 
67. In March 1999, as part of its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review process, the 
Commission took additional steps to reduce regulatory burdens on providers of international 
telecommunications services, citing rapid changes in the global telecommunications market.  The 
Commission streamlined its procedures for granting international section 214 authorizations to 
provide international services, and increased the categories of applications eligible for 
streamlined processing.   After adoption of the rules, most new carriers are authorized to provide 
international services on most international routes 14 days after public notice of an application.  
Carriers already providing service are able to complete pro forma transactions and assignments of 
their authorizations without prior Commission approval and to provide service through their 
wholly owned subsidiaries without separate Commission approval.  Carriers under common 
ownership with an already-authorized carrier are able to provide the same authorized services 
after only a minimal waiting period.  Authorized carriers are able to use any authorized U.S.-
licensed or non-U.S.-licensed undersea cable systems in the provision of their authorized 
services.  Approximately 99 percent of international section 214 applications now qualify for 
streamlined processing. 
c) Foreign Participation 
68. The Commission has sought to foster an increasingly competitive international 
telecommunications market by adopting policies that promote the shift away from government-
owned monopolies and toward private sector competition.  For example, the Commission has 
simplified its own licensing rules in ways that have facilitated entry into the U.S. market by 
foreign private sector competitors.  In the Foreign Participation Order,  the Commission 
broadened the class of foreign-affiliated applicants eligible for streamlined processing.  In 
addition, the competitive conditions created by the World Trade Organization (WTO) basic 
telecommunications agreement and the rules adopted in the Foreign Participation Order 
significantly reduced the possibility of market distortion, thereby allowing the Commission to 
reduce scrutiny of many applications and afford those applications streamlined processing.  
d) International Settlements Policy 
69. The Commission has taken action to remove regulatory impediments and 
increase competition in the international telecommunications marketplace through reform of the 
longstanding international settlements policy.  In 1999, in the ISP Reform Order, the Commission 
adopted sweeping deregulatory inter-carrier settlement arrangements between U.S. carriers and 
foreign non-dominant carriers on competitive routes.   Specifically, the Commission: (1) 
eliminated the international settlements policy and contract filing requirements for arrangements 
with foreign carriers that lack market power; (2) eliminated the international settlements policy 
for arrangements with all carriers on routes where rates to terminate U.S. calls are at least 25 
percent lower than the relevant settlement rate benchmark previously adopted by the Commission 
in its Settlement Rate Benchmark Order;  (3) adopted changes to contract filing requirements to 
permit U.S. carriers to file, on a confidential basis, arrangements with foreign carriers with 
market power on routes where the international settlements policy is removed;  (4) adopted 
procedural changes to simplify accounting rate filing requirements; (5) eliminated the flexibility 
policy in recognition that the reforms to the international settlements policy render the flexibility 
policy largely superfluous.  The Commission noted that the revisions to its rules will give greater 
opportunities to smaller carriers and will allow the market, rather than government regulation, to 
govern settlement arrangements between carriers in competitive markets.  These changes promote 
lower prices and greater innovation in international telecommunications services for U.S. 
consumers.
e) Automation
70. The International Bureau has made substantial progress in its ongoing efforts to 
automate its processes.  For example, the Bureau implemented a computerized notification 
system, enabling the ITU and other international entities to provide data to the Commission 
electronically.  In January 2000, the International Bureau successfully completed the transition 
from a paper and diskette distribution format, the ITU Weekly Information Circular (WIC), to a 
new computer-based CD-ROM system, the Radiocommunication Bureau International Frequency 
Information Circular (BRIFIC), for terrestrial service notifications.  The BRIFIC system 
completely replaces our reliance on paper notifications for these services and will save time and 
resources.  
3. New Initiatives
a) Earth Station Licensing 
71. The industry has provided substantial constructive comment on the Bureau's 
processes regarding satellite earth station licensing.  The greatest criticism is that the process to 
obtain an earth station license takes too long.  Industry members have suggested a variety of ways 
to address this problem.  Staff recommends that the Commission seek comment on 
comprehensive changes to the earth station licensing process in a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking.  The NPRM would seek comment on the proposals advanced by industry members.  
72. The staff also recommends that the Commission consider requiring electronic 
filing.  Electronic filing eliminates the need for staff to input information into the Bureau's 
database (which also reduces the chance of typographical errors generated by the staff).  The 
NPRM would also seek comment on various technical changes to Part 25 that could save 
substantial time in processing applications.
b) Space Segment Authorizations 
73. Currently it takes the Commission a minimum of just over two years to grant a 
space station application.  The satellite network licensing process takes several years longer when 
there is no spectrum allocation (International or Domestic), when no service rules exist for the 
proposed system, or when there are other countries ahead of the United States in the ITU 
coordination process. 
74. The Bureau's current "processing round" approach requires substantial staff time 
and resources to resolve all of the issues associated with a particular pool of applications.    On 
the other hand, a processing round approach sets parameters for licensing in an orderly fashion, 
taking into account mutual exclusivity considerations.  Through processing rounds, the 
Commission is able to identify the name, type and number of applications for a particular service 
and can avoid considering applications subsequently filed that may be mutually exclusive with 
previously filed applications.  
75. The major criticism of the current process is that service rulemakings and 
international coordination take too long to complete.  The International Bureau has made 
concerted efforts to streamline the satellite licensing process.  The staff believes that further 
improvements are warranted.  The Bureau is examining new options to improve and streamline 
the space segment licensing process as it relates to the development of new service rules and 
international coordination.  The Bureau plans to develop specific procedural and substantive 
proposals for new licensing approaches and establish goals for implementation. 
76. The Bureau also is continuing to work with the industry to re-examine the entire 
satellite network licensing process.  The International Bureau has convened several meetings with 
representatives of the U.S. and foreign satellite industry, including geostationary (GSO) 
companies, non-geostationary (NGSO) companies, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers, 
fixed satellite service (FSS) operators and mobile satellite service providers (MSS), to discuss 
satellite space station licensing.  Input from these industry meetings will be useful in the Bureau's 
new initiatives. 
c) Parts 23, 25 and 100 
77. The staff recommends that the Commission consider repealing section 25.141  
and subpart H  of its rules.  The staff also recommends that the Commission review sections 
25.140  and 25.144  of its rules.  Section 25.140 requires that each applicant for a fixed satellite 
service (FSS) authorization demonstrate that it is legally, financially, technically and otherwise 
qualified to proceed expeditiously with the construction, launch and/or operation of each 
proposed space station immediately after the grant of the requested authorization.   If the 
Commission determines that financial qualifications are still necessary, we recommend that the 
Commission review the rules to determine whether a different showing of financial qualifications 
may be warranted.  We recommend, however, that the Commission retain its technical and legal 
qualifications in their current form.  
78. Section 25.144 includes the licensing provisions for the 2.3 GHz satellite digital 
audio radio service (DARS).  The staff recommends that the Commission eliminate the 
subsection in 25.144 that identifies the specific DARS applicants eligible for the auction.  This 
subsection is no longer necessary because DARS licenses have already been issued.  The staff 
recommends, however, that the Commission retain the actual auction procedures for DARS in 
Part 25.
79. The staff further recommends that Parts 23 and 100 be retained in their entirety.  
Part 100 is the subject of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which has already been released by 
the Commission.  Part 23 should be considered by the Commission for further review.
d) Section 214 Applications
80. As part of the Telecommunications Division's ongoing efforts to improve 
service, the Division staff reviewed the rules in Part 63 relating to section 214 authorizations for 
international communications.  In addition, Bureau staff met with industry representatives to 
solicit suggestions on how to improve the rules.  On the basis of this review, and its daily work 
implementing the rules, the Bureau recommends that the Commission initiate a NPRM to expand 
the availability of pro forma section 214 transfers of control and assignments, which would 
reduce processing burdens and provide greater regulatory certainty.  The Bureau also has 
identified several duplicative rules that the Commission should consider eliminating, and a 
number of rules that are unclear, or ambiguous, or contain errors that the Commission should 
consider modifying.  
e) Submarine Cable
81. In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the number and capacity of 
submarine cables.  In particular, the development of the Internet has dramatically increased 
demand for submarine cable capacity.  To address issues relating to increased demand, the rapid 
pace of technological development, and the emergence of non-traditional ownership and 
financing structures in the submarine cable marketplace, the International Bureau held a public 
forum in November 1999.   The Bureau also has held numerous meetings with individual 
industry participants about ways the Commission might reform its regulation of the submarine 
cable landing licensing process to further promote competition.
82. On the basis of the public forum and meetings with industry, the Commission 
recently adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to continue the Commission's efforts to 
streamline the submarine cable landing license process.   In the Notice, the Commission 
proposed pro-competitive streamlining that incorporates competitive safeguards to allow for and 
encourage:  (1) more certainty and flexibility for participants in the application process; (2) 
increased investment and infrastructure development by multiple providers; (3) expansion of 
available submarine cable capacity; and (4) decreased application processing time.  This 
streamlining effort will benefit U.S. consumers by eliminating regulatory delay and enhancing the 
competitiveness of U.S. service providers in the world market. 
f) Reporting Requirements
83. The Bureau staff reviewed the rules in Part 43 relating to reporting requirements 
of carriers providing international telecommunications services.  In addition, Bureau staff met 
with industry representatives to solicit suggestions on how to improve the reporting requirements.  
The Bureau recommends that the Commission undertake a proceeding to review the reporting 
requirements.  The staff finds that these reporting requirements can be modified to reflect changes 
that have occurred in the telecommunications industry.  These reports aid the Commission, 
industry, and international agencies in planning and understanding international 
telecommunications markets.  The staff believes that the reporting burdens can be reduced 
without eliminating the benefits these reports provide.
84. The staff recommends that some of the rules relating to reports filed by carriers 
providing international telecommunications services be modified, and that others be eliminated.  
The staff has determined that reports regarding the division of international toll communications 
charges are no longer needed.  The purpose of those reports is to monitor telegraph 
communications, which is no longer a major component of telecommunications.  In addition, this 
reporting requirement is duplicative of other rules.  The requirement for reports of carriers owned 
by foreign telecommunications entities, which is designed to monitor foreign ownership of 
certain carriers, is no longer necessary in light of the development of competition in international 
telecommunications markets.  Although this reporting requirement has a sunset date, it can be 
eliminated prior to that sunset.  The Bureau also recommends that the instruction manual for 
reports of International Telecommunications Traffic be revised to reflect all the changes that have 
occurred over the past several years.
g) International Broadcasting Stations
85. International broadcasting stations are broadcast stations operating on certain 
high frequency bands whose transmissions are intended to be received directly by the general 
public in foreign countries.  The staff reviewed the Commission's rules governing international 
broadcasting stations  and determined that five of these rules should be revised to reflect actions 
taken at recent World Radio Conferences (WRCs).   First, the staff recommends that the 
Commission modify section 73.701(g) - (j) and (l) of the rules,  to reflect the Final Acts of WRC 
`97 (Geneva), which reduced the number of seasonal schedules per year (and thus the number of 
times per year that licensees have to file for frequency assignments) from four to two.  In 
addition, the staff recommends that the Commission change the starting and ending dates in the 
rule to the last Sunday in March and the last Sunday in September, and change the reference 
month in section 73.701(l) to specify either July or December.  Second, the staff recommends that 
the Commission modify section 73.702(f)(1) of the rules,  which lists the frequencies that can be 
assigned by the Commission for international broadcasting, to include additional bands approved 
for international broadcasting use by the World Radio Assembly Conference (WRAC) `92.   
Third, the staff recommends that the Commission replace the target zone map in section 73.703 
of the rules  with the current ITU target zone map, which was used for implementation of the 
WRC `97 Final Acts.  Fourth, the staff recommends that the Commission change the frequency 
control tolerance of 0.0015 percent of the assigned frequency, which is specified in section 
73.756(c) of the rules,  to the current ITU regulation standard of 10 Hz.  Finally, the staff 
recommends that the Commission modify the last sentence of section 73.766 of the rules  to 
change the highest modulating frequency from 5 kHz to 4.5 kHz, to reflect a provision in the 
Final Acts of WARC-87.  These changes would bring the Commission's international 
broadcasting rules into conformance with current international provisions.  This will make the 
rules easier to use and will avoid the confusion that could result from different Commission and 
international requirements.
h) Detariffing International Services
86. The Commission is in the process of detariffing interstate domestic interexchange 
services offered by non-dominant interexchange carriers (IXCs).   Similar to the domestic 
interexchange market, the international interexchange market has seen a substantial increase in 
the level of competition that has benefited consumers.  In light of this change, the staff 
recommends that the Commission extend the detariffing regime adopted for domestic 
interexchange services to the international services of non-dominant interexchange carriers, 
including Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers and U.S. carriers classified as dominant 
solely because of foreign affiliations.   Detariffing international interexchange services will 
reduce the burdens placed on carriers and the Commission.  The Commission will still be able to 
ensure that rates are just and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory; will be able to 
protect consumers by requiring carriers to disclose their rates publicly and through use of the 
section 208 complaint process;  and will promote the public interest by furthering competition in 
the international interexchange marketplace.
87. The staff also recommends that the Commission amend, as part of the detariffing 
process, the rule relating to the filing of contracts between carriers.  Specifically, the staff 
recommends that the Commission amend section 43.51 to simplify the language and to provide 
that the only contracts that need to be filed with the Commission are (1) contracts with a foreign 
carrier that has market power in a foreign market for common carrier service between the U.S. 
and that foreign location and (2) contracts involving a U.S. carrier that has been classified as 
dominant on any routes included in the contract, except for carriers classified as dominant on a 
particular route only because of a foreign carrier affiliation.   This will reduce burdens on 
carriers and the Commission.  Given the increasing level of competition in telecommunications 
markets, the staff does not believe that these contracts need to be filed.  The Commission and 
carriers should be able to ascertain when anti-competitive behavior occurs even if the contracts 
are not filed, and the Commission has authority to obtain the contracts if it needs to review them.
C. Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
88. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Wireless Bureau or WTB) is 
responsible for licensing and regulating all wireless communications services other than 
broadcast and satellite services.  Wireless communications services include commercially 
provided services such as cellular, Personal Communications Services (PCS), and paging, as well 
as public safety and other private radio services.  
89. The functions of the Wireless Bureau largely derive from Title III of the 
Communications Act, which governs licensing of spectrum in general and wireless services in 
particular.  As a result, the vast majority of the Commission's regulations affecting wireless 
carriers consist of (1) allocation and service rules, (2) procedural rules concerning licensing and 
auctions, and (3) technical and operational rules.  
90. The market for wireless carriers has changed dramatically in recent years as a 
result of entry by new wireless competitors, substantial growth, and increased competition in the 
wireless market.  In 1993, Congress granted authority to the Commission to award wireless 
licenses by auction.   Since that time, the Commission has conducted 30 spectrum auctions for 
services such as broadband and narrowband PCS, Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR), Wireless 
Communications Service (WCS), Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), and numerous 
other fixed and mobile wireless services.   This unprecedented wave of new licensing has 
resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of competing wireless service providers.   
91. As a result of increased wireless licensing and new competition, the Commission 
has substantially deregulated many aspects of wireless services.  For example, in 1994, pursuant 
to authority granted under section 332 of the Communications Act, the Commission eliminated 
all federal rate regulation of commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers, and preempted 
all state rate regulation as well.   In 1996, the Commission revised its technical and operational 
rules to give CMRS carriers flexibility to provide fixed as well as mobile services, so that carriers 
could better respond to customer demands for new and innovative services.   The dynamic and 
rapidly evolving nature of the wireless industry continues to make it important for the 
Commission to review its wireless regulations on a regular basis. 
1. Scope of Review
92. As part of the review process initiated by the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review 
Working Group, WTB has reviewed the following rule parts that affect wireless 
telecommunications carriers.
Part 1 - Practice and Procedure -  In addition to procedural rules of general applicability 
to all Commission licensees, subpart F relates to licensing and application procedures for 
wireless services, and subpart Q contains auction rules for wireless services.
Part 17 - Construction, Marking, and Lighting of Antenna Structures - Establishes 
construction, marking, and lighting requirements for antenna structures that affect 
aviation safety, and sets forth procedures for registering such structures with the 
Commission.  
Part 20 - Commercial Mobile Radio Services - Contains rules that are generally 
applicable to all CMRS providers, including the CMRS spectrum cap, resale and roaming 
rules, and E911 requirements.

2. Recent and Ongoing Activities
93. Prior to and contemporaneously with the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review, 
WTB has engaged in a number of major initiatives to streamline and eliminate unnecessary rules.
a) Universal Licensing Proceeding 
94. In the Universal Licensing proceeding, which was part of the 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review, the Commission furthered the implementation of the Universal Licensing 
System (ULS) by consolidating and streamlining its licensing rules and procedures for all 
wireless services.   Major accomplishments in this proceeding include: (1) establishing an 
electronic filing requirement for all wireless services, which significantly reduces filing burdens 
on wireless applicants and speeds the licensing process;  (2) consolidating all wireless licensing 
rules into Part 1, by which the Commission eliminated more than 200 duplicative and sometimes 
inconsistent licensing rules that previously governed applications and licensing in individual 
wireless services;  (3) reducing the number of wireless application forms from more than 40 
different application forms in use for different purposes in different wireless services to four 
standardized application forms; and (4) eliminating obsolete or burdensome application filing 
rules and procedures, such as the requirement that common carrier licensees file microfiche 
copies of their applications. 
b) Part 90 Biennial Regulatory Review Proceeding
95. This proceeding, also initiated as part of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review, 
addresses rules applicable to Part 90 private land mobile licensees.   In the Report and Order 
recently adopted in this proceeding, the Commission took the following actions:  (1) lengthened 
license terms for Part 90 licensees from 5 to 10 years, which increases licensee flexibility and 
reduces filing burdens;  (2) extended the construction period for private land mobile licensees 
from 8 to 12 months; and (3) streamlined, clarified, and eliminated other Part 90 rules.  
c) Amendment of the Commission's Part 97 Amateur Radio Rules
96. This proceeding simplified licensing classifications in the Amateur Radio 
Service, streamlined and updated Amateur license examination procedures, and eliminated other 
outdated rules.  
d) Pro Forma Assignments and Transfers 
97. In 1998, the Commission granted section 10 forbearance of section 310(d), which 
required prior Commission approval for most pro forma assignments and transfers involving 
wireless telecommunications carriers.   This action enables telecommunications carriers to carry 
out non-substantial transfers and assignments without regulatory delays, subject only to the 
requirement that they notify the Commission of the change.
e) Local Number Portability
98. In 1999, the Commission granted a petition by the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association to extend the deadline for CMRS providers to establish a local number 
portability (LNP) capability in their networks.    As a result of the Commission's decision to 
apply section 10 forbearance in this case, the LNP implementation deadline for CMRS providers 
has been extended until November 2002.  This will give CMRS providers greater flexibility in the 
near term to build out their systems and increase capacity to meet growing consumer demand for 
wireless services.  
f) LMDS Eligibility
99. In June 2000, the Commission adopted the Third Report and Order in CC Docket 
No. 92-97, in which it allowed the Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) eligibility 
restriction to sunset on June 30, 2000.   The LMDS eligibility restriction, adopted in 1997, 
prohibited local exchange carriers and incumbent cable companies from having an attributable 
interest in any LMDS "A" block license that overlapped with ten percent or more of the 
population in their service areas.  In the Third Report and Order, the Commission concluded that 
allowing this eligibility restriction to sunset would promote the public interest.  After reviewing 
the restriction, the Commission found that the record did not support a conclusion that open 
eligibility posed a significant threat of competitive harm in specific markets; indeed, the 
Commission concluded that open eligibility may improve the availability of services, particularly 
in rural areas.
g) Streamlining Initiatives
100. The Wireless Bureau has engaged in a comprehensive effort to streamline its 
procedures, to resolve pending applications and requests expeditiously, and to operate more 
efficiently.  Some of the Bureau's more significant accomplishments are:  
(1) Deploying the ULS and expanding use of electronic filing.  This has resulted in 
electronic filing of more than 60 percent of wireless applications.  
(2) Expanding and expediting the licensing process via auctions.  The Bureau has 
conducted eight auctions since January 1999, in which more than 5,000 licenses have 
been awarded.  The Bureau plans to conduct an additional four auctions during the 
remainder of this year.  
(3) Eliminating the case backlog.  Between March 1999 and March 2000, the Bureau 
reduced by 99 percent a backlog of more than 64,000 applications that had been pending 
for more than one year, and implemented tracking procedures to prevent future backlogs.
(4) Resolving pending matters quickly.  In 1999, the Bureau processed more than 
400,000 license applications, issued more than 500 decisions on delegated authority, and 
had 112 orders adopted by the Commission.
(5) Processing license transfers and assignments efficiently.  From October 1999 to April 
2000, the Bureau processed approximately 1900 transfer and assignment applications, 
including such major transactions as AT&T/Vanguard, Bell Atlantic/Vodafone, 
Nextel/Geotek, Omnipoint/Voicestream, and Arch/PageNet.  Seventy percent of the 
transfer and assignment applications filed with the Bureau were processed in 90 days or 
less, and 87 percent were processed in 180 days or less.

3. New Initiatives
101. In general, the Bureau has not recommended repeal or significant modification of 
allocation and service rules, procedural rules concerning licensing and auctions, and technical and 
operational rules, which, as noted above, constitute the majority of the rules subject to review that 
affect wireless carriers.  The staff has determined that these types of rules are integral to the basic 
licensing and spectrum management functions performed by the Bureau and the Commission 
under Title III of the Communications Act.  The continued need for such rules is not diminished 
by increased competition in the wireless marketplace.  Indeed, without basic "rules of the road" 
for spectrum use, the ability of wireless carriers to compete would be significantly impaired.  
102. Nevertheless, the Bureau has determined that there are several areas where 
competitive conditions, technological changes, or administrative efficiency may warrant changing 
or eliminating regulations.  In addition, the Bureau and the Biennial Regulatory Review Working 
Group have received numerous suggestions from outside parties, such as the Cellular 
Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), the Personal Communications Industry 
Association (PCIA), and the Federal Communications Bar Association (FCBA), of possible areas 
for streamlining or eliminating wireless rules.  
a) Part 22 Cellular Rules
103. The Commission's rules regulating cellular telephone service, contained in Part 
22, were largely adopted in the early 1980s when the service was initiated.   At the time these 
rules were adopted, the two cellular carriers in each market (one of which in each market was 
affiliated with the incumbent LEC) were the only providers of mobile telephony, thus creating a 
"duopoly" market for this service.  In addition, those cellular licenses not granted to incumbent 
LECs were awarded primarily by lottery, which caused the Commission to adopt regulations to 
prevent speculation and trafficking in licenses.  Finally, to ensure technical uniformity in the 
deployment of cellular, the rules included detailed technical requirements for the provision of 
analog cellular service.  Since these rules were adopted, PCS and SMR providers have entered the 
mobile telephony market, significantly changing the competitive landscape.  The Commission has 
also replaced the lottery process with licensing by auction, and there have been significant 
advances in wireless technology, including the development of several competing digital 
interfaces.  As a result of these changes, many of the Part 22 cellular rules adopted in the duopoly 
era appear to be no longer necessary.  Therefore, the Bureau staff recommends initiating a 
rulemaking to review the cellular rules and consider which of these rules are obsolete as a result 
of competitive or  technological developments.  The Bureau staff also recommends review of 
rules regulating other Part 22 services, such as paging and air-to-ground service, on the same 
basis.
b) License Renewal Procedures
104. In most instances, wireless licenses must be renewed every 10 years.  As a 
practical matter, granting renewal of wireless licenses has proved to be virtually automatic except 
where the licensee has violated Commission rules, which only occurs in a very small percentage 
of cases.  However, the renewal process in some instances places significant burdens on 
licensees.  In a small but significant number of cases, the Bureau has encountered problems with 
late-filed renewal applications, in many instances involving public safety licensees that provide 
essential emergency services to their communities.  To address these issues, the staff recommends 
initiating a proceeding that would consider changes to renewal procedures for public safety 
licenses in particular and that would review renewal procedures for other wireless licenses as 
well.  Among the options that could be considered are:  (1) extending license terms beyond 10 
years, and (2) implementing automatic or default renewal procedures to avoid late filing 
problems.  Reform of renewal procedures was an issue specifically raised by CTIA and other 
industry representatives in meetings with Bureau staff.
c) Privatization of Microwave Licensing
105. Under its Part 101 rules, the Commission licenses some private and common 
carrier microwave services on a site-by-site, frequency-by-frequency basis.  Although this 
licensing procedure facilitates efficient use of the spectrum, the licensing process is 
administratively complex and resource-intensive for applicants and the Commission.  The staff 
recommends initiating a proceeding that would consider the possibility of partially privatizing the 
licensing process in these services.  If implemented, licensing functions within designated 
spectrum could be performed by private coordinators, who would also be responsible for 
maintaining the licensee database.
d) CMRS Spectrum Cap Review
106. The CMRS spectrum cap, set forth in section 20.6 of the rules, limits the 
aggregate amount of broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum that an entity can hold in any 
market.   The rule was adopted in the CMRS Third Report and Order prior to the initiation of 
broadband PCS licensing.   In the September 1999 Spectrum Cap Report and Order, the 
Commission considered whether to retain, modify, or eliminate the spectrum cap.  The 
Commission concluded that the cap continued to serve the public interest by preventing undue 
concentration in the CMRS market.  The Commission also concluded that the cap should be 
relaxed in some respects, including liberalizing certain of the attribution rules and allowing 
aggregation of up to 55 MHz of spectrum in rural areas (as opposed to the 45 MHz limit in major 
markets).  Finally, the Commission stated that it would again review the spectrum cap in the 2000 
Biennial Regulatory Review.  In accordance with this directive, the Bureau plans to prepare a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Commission consideration later this year that will initiate this 
review, taking into consideration existing competitive conditions and technological developments 
that could affect the continued need for the cap. 
4. Other Issues
107. The Bureau is also considering several other possible areas for new Biennial 
Regulatory Review initiatives.  For example, the Bureau is reviewing its procedures for 
environmental clearance of tower sites under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to 
determine whether it can implement its responsibilities under NEPA more effectively and 
efficiently.  The Bureau has also received Biennial Regulatory Review suggestions from outside 
parties such as CTIA and PCIA, including: streamlining procedures for submission of 
confidential information; streamlining and consolidating reporting obligations applicable to 
wireless carriers (e.g., TRS, Universal Service, broadband competition, regulatory fees); and 
reviewing our buildout requirements for different wireless services.  The Bureau has taken these 
suggestions under consideration and will announce further initiatives as appropriate.
V. SUMMARY OF REVIEW BY MASS MEDIA BUREAU 
108. The Mass Media Bureau advises the Commission in matters pertaining to radio 
stations, television stations, Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS), Multichannel Multipoint 
Distribution Service (MMDS), and Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) facilities.  The 
Bureau is responsible for licensing these services and administers Commission rules and policies 
pertaining to these services, including ownership rules.  The Bureau has been engaged in a 
thorough review of its rules and policies to promote competition and diversity, to minimize 
unwarranted regulatory burdens, and to streamline our licensing processes.  These rules are 
located in Parts 73, 74, and 21 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
109. A variety of video outlets currently serve over 100 million television households 
in the United States.   The average television household in the United States can receive 13 
over-the-air television stations, while 36 percent of all homes can receive 15 or more stations and 
9 percent can receive 20 or more stations.   Over 10,400 cable systems pass by 96 million 
homes and serve almost 67 million television households.   Sixty-four percent of all subscribers 
have at least 54 channels and over 98 percent have a minimum of 30 channels.   Other video 
providers include Direct Broadcast Satellite, MMDS, satellite master antenna television, home 
satellite dishes, and open video systems.
110. Over 12,600 radio stations are currently on the air (4,783 AM, 5,766 commercial 
FM and 2,066 educational FM).   Listeners in over half of the Arbitron radio markets are served 
by more than 20 commercial radio stations, and listeners in over 90 percent of the markets are 
served by more than 10 commercial radio stations.   The 1996 Act eliminated the Commission's 
national radio ownership limits and relaxed the local radio ownership limits.  In response, the 
radio industry has consolidated ownership during the past four years, with the number of radio 
owners declining by approximately 1,100.  Thus, there are now approximately 4,000 owners of 
commercial radio stations.  The average number of owners of commercial radio stations in 
Arbitron radio metro markets has declined by 3 (from 14 to 11) since the 1996 Act.  Prior to the 
1996 Act, the largest radio group owner had fewer than 40 radio stations nationwide.  In March 
2000, the two largest radio group owners each had over 440 radio stations, and there were several 
radio owners with more than 100 radio stations.  As a result of this consolidation, approximately 
two-thirds of all commercial radio stations are owned as part of radio groups. 
111. Commercial broadcasters fund their activities by selling advertisers access to 
their audiences (they receive no revenue from listeners or viewers).   Broadcast programming is 
limited to the geographic reach of any given station's signal.  This creates an incentive for 
broadcast networks to forge arrangements with many stations, thereby expanding their geographic 
reach and attracting a broader range of advertisers.  Once broadcast television transitions to a 
digital service, DTV could provide multiple streams of video programming and allow 
broadcasters to charge subscriber fees for several program services.
112. Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act requires the Commission to review its ownership 
rules biennially to "determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the public interest as the 
result of competition."  The Commission has undertaken a number of deregulatory initiatives with 
respect to the broadcast ownership rules.  The Bureau is committed to reevaluating regulatory 
standards on an ongoing basis to respond to changes in the broadcast industry.
113. One important policy goal for mass media, and one of the most important 
purposes of the Commission's multiple ownership rules, is to encourage diversity in the 
ownership of broadcast stations in order to ensure that a diversity of viewpoints is available over 
the airwaves.   As the Supreme Court stated, "it has long been a basic tenet of national 
communications policy that `the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and 
antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public.'"   This diversity policy is 
consistent with the First Amendment goal of fostering the "marketplace of ideas"  and 
encouraging "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate.   For these reasons, the Supreme 
Court has stated that it has "no difficulty" in concluding that the Commission's interest in 
"promoting widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources" is "an 
important governmental interest;" indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that "assuring that the 
public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the 
highest order, for it promotes values central to the First Amendment."  
114. Broadcast stations, particularly television stations, reach large audiences and are 
the primary source of news and entertainment programming for Americans.   Broadcasters 
consequently play a leading role in airing democratic debate and shaping cultural attitudes.  For 
example, the manner and viewpoint a station uses in presenting the news can have a substantial 
impact on local elections.  A television drama that raises controversial or important societal issues 
can shape cultural attitudes about these issues in significant ways.  There is consequently a vital 
public interest in ensuring that these influential outlets for communication are in the hands of a 
broad number of different owners. 
115. The strong policy of promoting diversity is relevant to determining whether a 
regulation is necessary in the public interest.  Whether or not a particular ownership combination 
has anticompetitive effects in the sale of advertising time or other markets in which broadcasters 
compete, that combination may reduce the diversity of voices in a community.  Congress 
implicitly recognized this by maintaining local radio ownership limitations, albeit at relaxed 
levels.   Congress has repeatedly emphasized its concern for promoting diversity in the mass 
media, notwithstanding the increasingly competitive nature of virtually all communications 
markets.   In attempting to foster diversity through structural regulation, the Commission 
endorses a content-neutral method that does not evaluate the substance of any station's editorial 
decisions, but seeks to ensure a sufficient number of independent outlets and program sources to 
foster a diversity of independent viewpoints in a given local market.  
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
116. On August 6, 1999, the Commission released its Local Television Ownership 
Report and Order  and its National Television Ownership Report and Order.   As discussed 
more fully below, the Commission, in the Local Television Ownership Report and Order, revised 
its local television ownership rules - the "TV duopoly" rule and the radio-television cross-
ownership or "one-to-a-market" rule - to respond to ongoing changes in the broadcast television 
industry.  The new rules reflect a recognition of the growth in the number and variety of media 
outlets in local markets, as well as significant efficiencies and public service benefits that can be 
obtained from joint ownership.  At the same time, the Commission's amendments reflect its 
continuing goals of ensuring diversity and localism and guarding against undue concentration of 
economic power in the marketplace.  The newly adopted rules balance these competing concerns 
and are intended to facilitate further development of competition in the marketplace and to 
strengthen the potential to serve the public interest.  In the National Television Ownership Report 
and Order, the Commission modified its method of calculating stations' audience reach and made 
some minor changes in which stations would be counted for purposes of the national TV 
ownership rule.
117. On June 20, 2000, the Commission released its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review 
Report,  which discusses all of the Commission's broadcast ownership rules not already 
considered in the 1999 Local and National Television Ownership Report and Orders.  The 1998 
Biennial Regulatory Review Report considers (1) the local radio ownership rules, including the 
radio market definition; (2) the daily newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule; (3) the national 
television ownership rule, including the "UHF discount;" (4) the dual network rule; (5) the 
experimental broadcast station ownership rule; and (6) the cable/television cross-ownership rule.  
The Report then states the Commission's conclusions as to whether the rules remain necessary in 
the public interest in view of competition.
a) Broadcast Ownership Rules
(1) Local Radio Ownership Rule
118. In 1996, the Commission revised the number of radio stations that an entity may 
own in a single radio market under section 73.3555(a) of its rules in accordance with section 
202(b) of the 1996 Act.   The Commission also reviewed the rule in its 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review Report.  On the basis of that recently concluded review under the biennial 
regulatory review requirements of the 1996 Act, the Commission concluded that local radio 
ownership rules generally continue to serve the pubic interest.  Noting that there currently are far 
fewer licensees competing against each other in many communities than there were prior to the 
1996 Act, the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report concluded that the existing limitations 
remain necessary to prevent further diminution of competition and diversity in the radio industry.
119. The Commission, however, recognized that its methodology for counting the 
number of stations a party owned in a market may have, under certain circumstances, created 
results that were inconsistent with congressional intent.   For example, the Commission noted 
that its current methodology may result in a station being counted as part of a market but not 
counted against a licensee's cap on the number of stations it may own in that market.  The 
Commission therefore stated that it will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment 
on its methodology for defining radio markets, counting the number of stations within those 
markets, and counting the number of stations that a party owns in a radio market.
(2) Local Television Multiple Ownership Rule
120. Section 73.3555(b) of the Commission's rules limits the number of television 
stations an entity may own in a single market.   The 1999 Local Television Ownership Report 
and Order relaxed this rule by (1) modifying the geographic scope from the Grade B contour 
overlap approach to a Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) test that permits common 
ownership of two television stations in separate DMAs without regard to contour overlap; (2) 
allowing common ownership of two television stations within the same DMA if their Grade B 
contours do not overlap (a continuation of the previous rule), or if eight independently-owned, 
full power and operational TV stations (commercial and non-commercial) will remain post-
merger, and one of the stations to be merged is not among the top four-ranked stations in the 
market, on the basis of audience share at the time the application is filed; and (3) allowing waiver 
of the new rules under certain circumstances.  As the Commission stated in the 1999 Local 
Television Ownership Report and Order, the relaxed rules provide measured relaxation of the 
local television multiple ownership rule, particularly in larger television markets.  The rule will 
allow weaker television stations in a market to combine, either with each other or with a larger 
station, thereby preserving and strengthening these stations and improving their ability to 
compete.  These station combinations will allow licensees to take advantage of efficiencies and 
cost savings that can benefit the public.  At the same time, the station rank and voice criteria are 
designed to protect both the Commission's core competition and diversity concerns.   Because 
the local television multiple ownership rule was so recently relaxed, the staff believes that no 
further changes are warranted at this time.  Instead, staff will monitor the effects of deregulatory 
actions on the marketplace to determine whether further changes are warranted.
(3) Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule
121. Section 73.3555(c) of the Commission's rules limits the number of radio and 
television stations that an entity may own in a single market.   The 1999 Local Television 
Ownership Report and Order relaxed the Commission's radio-television cross-ownership rule to 
allow common ownership of a television station (or two television stations if permitted under our 
local television ownership rules) and up to six radio stations (any combination of AM or FM 
stations, to the extent permitted under our local radio ownership rules) in any market where at 
least 20 independent voices would remain post-merger; a television station and up to four radio 
stations (any combination of AM or FM stations, to the extent permitted under our local radio 
ownership rules) in any market where at least 10 independent voices would remain post-merger; 
and a television station and one radio station (AM or FM) notwithstanding the number of 
independent voices in the market.  The 1999 Local Television Ownership Report and Order also 
eliminated the previous five-factor case-by-case waiver standard  and established a simplified 
waiver standard.   The Commission stated in the 1999 Local Television Ownership Report and 
Order that it relaxed the radio-television cross-ownership rule to balance its traditional diversity 
and competition concerns with its desire to permit broadcasters and the public to realize the 
benefits of radio-television common ownership.  The relaxed rule recognizes the growth in the 
number and types of media outlets, the clustering of cable systems in major population centers, 
the efficiencies inherent in joint ownership and operation of both television and radio stations in 
the same market, as well as public service benefits that can be obtained from joint operation.  The 
new rule also ensures the application of a clear, reasonable standard.  As a result, the rule will 
ease administrative burdens and will provide predictability to broadcasters in structuring their 
business transactions.  Because the radio-television cross-ownership rule was so recently 
relaxed, the staff believes that no further changes are warranted at this time.  Staff will monitor 
the market effects of deregulatory actions to determine whether further changes are warranted.
(4) Daily Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule
122. Section 73.3555(d) of the Commission's rules generally prohibits the common 
ownership of a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same community.   The 
Commission reviewed this rule in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report.  In that review, 
the Commission recognized that even though media markets have undergone changes since the 
cross-ownership rule was adopted, many of the new media outlets do not yet appear to be 
substitutes for newspapers or broadcast stations on the local level, for diversity purposes.  The 
1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report therefore concludes that the rule should, as a general 
matter, be retained because it furthers the important public policy goal of viewpoint diversity and 
continues to serve the public interest.  
123. While electing to retain the rule, the Commission recognized that situations may 
arise where the rule may not be necessary in the public interest to ensure diversity and 
competition.  For example, given the size of the market and the size and type of the newspaper 
and broadcast station involved, there may be sufficient diversity and competition even if a 
newspaper/broadcast combination were allowed.  The Commission indicated in the 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review Report that it would examine these types of situations in greater detail.  The 
Commission indicated that it would examine whether the rule needs to be tailored to address 
contemporary market conditions and would issue a notice of proposed rule making seeking 
comment on these and other potential modifications of the rule. 
124. On October 1, 1996, the Commission released a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) seeking 
comment on the possible revision of its standards for waiver of the daily newspaper/broadcast 
cross-ownership rule with respect to newspaper/radio combinations.   The Newspaper/Radio 
Cross-Ownership Waiver Policy NOI sought comment on whether the Commission should adopt 
objective criteria for evaluating these waiver requests and, if so, what those criteria should be.  
No action has been taken in this proceeding.
(5) National Television Multiple Ownership Rule
125. Section 73.3555(e) of the Commission's rules prohibits an entity from owning 
television stations that would result in an aggregate national audience reach exceeding 35 
percent.   The current cap was established in 1996, when Congress directed the Commission to 
raise the national cap from 25 percent to 35 percent.   The 1999 National Television Ownership 
Report and Order generally clarifies that no market will be counted more than once when 
calculating the 35 percent cap,  and uses DMAs, rather than Arbitron's Areas of Dominant 
Influence, to define a station's market for the purpose of calculating national audience reach.   
More recently, the Commission, in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report, addressed the 
issue of whether to modify the 35 percent cap.  The Commission determined that its recent 
changes to the local television ownership rule should be observed and assessed before making 
any further changes to the national limit.  The Commission also found that many group owners 
have acquired large numbers of stations nationwide since the cap was increased to 35 percent in 
1996, and that this trend needed further observation.  The 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review 
Report therefore did not alter the 35 percent cap. 
126. Section 73.3555(e)(2) provides for a 50 percent "UHF discount" in calculating 
the national audience reach.   Because the UHF discount is intended to recognize the 
deficiencies in over-the-air UHF reception in comparison to VHF reception, UHF stations are not 
"credited" with reaching their entire market.  The Commission addressed the issue of whether to 
retain the 50 percent UHF discount in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report and concluded 
that the signal disparity between UHF and VHF has not yet been eliminated.  The 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review Report therefore retains the 50 percent UHF discount.  Because the signal 
disparity should be diminished by digital television, however, the Report states that when the 
transition to digital television is near completion, the Commission will issue a notice of proposed 
rulemaking proposing a phased-in elimination of the discount.
(6) Dual Network Rule
127. As mandated by the 1996 Act, section 73.658(g) of the Commission's rules 
permits a broadcast station to affiliate with a network organization that maintains more than one 
broadcast network, unless the dual or multiple networks are created by a merger between ABC, 
CBS, Fox, or NBC, or a merger between one of these four established networks and UPN or 
WB.   The Commission reviewed this rule in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report.  The 
Commission recognized that the rule, as it applies to UPN and WB, may no longer be necessary 
in the public interest.  The Commission stated that the opportunity for broadcast networks to 
create and maintain multiple broadcast networks may place networks on more equal footing with 
cable, satellite, and other multi-channel video programming distributors.  The Commission 
further noted that because the emerging networks (UPN and WB) are nascent subsidiaries of large 
program producers, their merger with a major network (ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC) may permit 
realization of substantial economic efficiencies without undue harm to diversity and competition.  
The Commission has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to consider eliminating the 
restriction on the ownership of UPN or WB by one of the four established networks and seeking 
comment on what, if any, safeguards should be imposed.   The Commission, however, declined 
to eliminate the prohibition against any mergers of the four major networks because of significant 
concerns about competition and diversity. 
(7) Experimental Broadcast Station Multiple Ownership Rule
128. Section 74.134 of the Commission's rules prohibits any person from controlling 
two or more experimental broadcast stations unless it can show that the research program requires 
the licensing of two or more separate stations.   The Commission reviewed this rule in its 1998 
Biennial Regulatory Review Report and concluded that elimination of the rule would not 
adversely affect diversity and competition.  The Commission stated that other rules, which 
require experimental stations to operate for research purposes and bar them from imposing 
charges for transmitting programming and from offering a regular program service, provide 
sufficient safeguards against use of experimental stations for commercial purposes.  The 
Commission has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to eliminate the rule. 
(8) Cable/Television Cross-Ownership Rule
129. Section 76.501(a) of the Commission's rules prohibits a cable system from 
carrying the signal of a television station if the system owns or controls a TV station whose 
predicted Grade B contour overlaps the service area of the cable system.   The Commission 
reviewed this rule in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report and concluded that the 
cable/television cross-ownership rule promotes competition in the delivered video programming 
market.  The Commission noted that, despite an array of participants in the delivered video 
programming market, 67 percent of television households subscribe to cable.  The Commission 
also noted that this rule prevents other forms of discrimination that could degrade competition in 
the delivered video programming market.  The 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report therefore 
retains the rule.  The staff does not find any reason to alter that decision.
b) Other Rules
(1) Broadcast Attribution Report and Order
130. The 1999 Attribution Report and Order amended Note 2 to section 73.3555 of 
the Commission's rules, the broadcast attribution rules, which determines what interests should 
be counted in applying the ownership rules.   The 1999 Attribution Report and Order amended 
the attribution rules to improve their precision, avoid disruption in the flow of capital to 
broadcasting, afford clarity and certainty to regulatees and markets, and facilitate application 
processing.  A number of measures were adopted in the 1999 Attribution Report and Order.  In 
particular, the Order eliminated the cross-interest policy, which had required a time-consuming 
case-by-case review, and adopted instead a new equity/debt plus rule that addressed some of the 
same concerns.  In addition, the Commission raised the passive investor voting stock benchmark 
from 10 to 20 percent.  The 1999 Attribution Report and Order also conformed the 
cable/Multipoint Distribution Service attribution rules to the newly adopted broadcast attribution 
criteria and amended the attribution rules regarding cable/television cross-ownership and the 
ITFS cross-leasing rules.
(2) Main Studio and Public File Report and Order
131. The Main Studio and Public File Rules Report and Order provided broadcasters 
greater flexibility in choosing where to locate their main studios, required commercial and 
noncommercial educational stations to locate the public files at their main studio, and allowed 
licensees to maintain all or part of the files in a computer database, rather than in paper files.   
The Main Studio and Public File Rules Report and Order further clarified what must be 
contained in the public inspection files.  The Commission's goals in amending these rules was to 
strike an appropriate balance between ensuring that the public has reasonable access to each 
station's main studio and public file, minimizing regulatory burdens on licensees, and 
establishing rules that are easy to administer and understand.
(3) Call Sign Report and Order
132. The Call Sign Report and Order amended several rules to ease and speed call 
sign request processing.   Specifically, the Call Sign Report and Order amended the 
Commission's rules to replace the requirement that parties file written requests for the registration 
or change of call signs with a new on-line call sign inquiry, reservation, and authorization system 
that is accessible through the Internet.   The Commission further amended its low-power 
television station identification rules to allow low-power television permittees and licensees to be 
assigned four-letter call signs, via the Internet on-line process, in lieu of five-character 
alphanumeric call signs.   These revised rules will streamline the Commission's call sign 
assignment procedures.  Implementation of the on-line system enhances the speed and certainty 
of radio and television broadcast station call sign assignments, thereby providing better service to 
all broadcast station licensees and permittees.
(4) Competitive Bidding for Commercial Broadcast and 
Instructional Television Fixed Service Licenses
133. The Commission traditionally used comparative hearings to decide among 
mutually exclusive applications to provide commercial broadcast service, and it has used a system 
of random selection to award certain types of broadcast licenses, such as low-power television 
and television translator licenses.  As a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which 
expanded the Commission's competitive bidding authority under section 309(j) of the 
Communications Act, as amended,  the Commission no longer has the option of resolving 
competing applications for commercial broadcast stations by comparative hearings, except for 
certain applications filed before July 1, 1997.  In addition, the Balanced Budget Act removed the 
Commission's authority to resolve competing applications for commercial broadcast stations by a 
system of random selection.  In response to these legislative changes, the Competitive Bidding 
First Report and Order  adopted new competitive bidding rules to select among mutually 
exclusive applications for new commercial full-power radio station licenses, analog television 
station licenses, and a variety of secondary commercial broadcast service licenses (low-power 
television, FM translator, and television translator services).  In contrast to the comparative 
hearing process, the competitive bidding rules provide a more streamlined method for awarding 
authorizations, and, as a result, expedite service to the public.
(5) 1998 Nontechnical Streamlining Report and Order
134. The Commission recently concluded a review of its broadcast rules and 
application procedures.  The Nontechnical Streamlining Report and Order made fundamental 
changes in the Commission's broadcast application and licensing procedures to reduce 
unwarranted applicant and licensee burdens, while preserving the public's ability to participate 
fully in the broadcast licensing process.   The Commission extended the construction period for 
all broadcast stations to three years (from 18 months for radio stations and 24 months for 
television stations), but tightened standards for granting extensions.  With respect to the 
procedures for transfer and assignment applications, the Commission eliminated the prohibition 
on for-profit sales of unbuilt stations.   In addition, applicants now certify that their sales and 
organizational documents comply with Commission policy and rules.   Similarly, staff no longer 
routinely reviews contour overlap maps; applicants now certify compliance with multiple 
ownership rules.   In addition, broadcast licensees now file ownership reports every two years, 
rather than yearly.  The Nontechnical Streamlining Report and Order also applied the two-year 
ownership report filing requirement to noncommercial educational broadcasters and eliminated 
the requirement that a noncommercial educational licensee file an ownership report within 30 
days after any change in previously reported information.   Both commercial and 
noncommercial educational licensees, however, must file a new ownership report within 30 days 
of consummating authorized license assignments or transfers of control of licensee entities.
135. In addition to streamlining the application procedures, the Commission adopted 
new certification-based application procedures and mandatory electronic filing rules for fifteen 
key Mass Media Bureau broadcast application and reporting forms.  These changes are designed 
to make filings easier, faster, and more resistant to error.  For example, electronic filing 
automatically notifies applicants of any critical errors in their applications, and allows the public 
to view the applications on the Commission's web site.  When fully implemented, these reforms 
will significantly reduce burdens on applicants and Commission staff, facilitate application 
processing, and result in more accurate databases and easier public access to information.  
Electronic submission furthers the Commission's long-standing commitment to using new 
information technologies for enhancing service to licensees and to the public.  On April 28, 2000, 
the Mass Media Bureau implemented electronic filing procedures for six broadcast application 
forms.  Electronic filing of these forms will become mandatory in October 2000. 
(6) 1999 Technical Streamlining Report and Order
136. On June 15, 1998, the Commission released a notice of proposed rulemaking 
seeking comment on streamlining AM and FM, noncommercial educational (NCE) FM, and FM 
translator technical rules.   The Commission addressed many of the proposals from the 
Technical Streamlining Notice in the 1999 Technical Streamlining First Report and Order.  The 
1999 Technical Streamlining First Report and Order in this proceeding extended first-come, 
first-served processing to applications for minor changes to AM, NCE FM, and FM translator 
facilities.   The 1999 Technical Streamlining First Report and Order also expanded the 
definition of "minor change" in these services to conform more closely to the commercial FM 
definition.  The expanded "minor" change application definition permits expeditious processing 
of most facility modifications under our efficient and proven first-come, first-served rules.  
Finally, the 1999 Technical Streamlining First Report and Order amended the Commission's 
contingent application rule, which had prohibited the filing of coordinated facility modifications.  
The revised rule permits the simultaneous filing of up to four "related" minor change FM station 
construction permit applications. 
2. New Initiatives
137. The Commission has significantly reduced the burdens of its mass media rules 
and policies over the past few years.  Bureau staff is in the process of reviewing petitions for 
reconsideration of the rules the Commission adopted in the 1999 Local and National Television 
Reports and Orders as well as the 1999 Attribution Report and Order.  Moreover, the Bureau is 
initiating several rulemaking proceedings, as described above, that are based on the 
Commission's findings in its 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report on the mass media 
ownership rules.
VI. SUMMARY OF REVIEWS BY OTHER BUREAUS AND OFFICES
A. Cable Services Bureau
138. The Cable Services Bureau advises the Commission in matters pertaining to the 
regulation and development of cable television and other multichannel video programming 
services.  The Bureau administers rules and policies regarding cable television service and 
systems, including, for example, ownership of cable systems; promotion of competition; pole 
attachment issues; the preemption of restrictions on devices designed for over-the-air television 
broadcast signals, and the accessibility of video programming to persons with disabilities.
139. Section 11 and section 202(h) of the 1996 Act do not specifically refer to cable 
operators and cable regulation.  The Bureau does administer section 224 of the Communications 
Act and the Commission's rules for pole attachments (Part I, subpart J), which provide cable 
operators and telecommunications providers with nondiscriminatory access to a utility's poles, 
ducts, conduits, and right of ways (see section XV below).The Bureau's review of the rules it 
administers, however, is consistent with the general spirit and purpose of section 11, which 
directs the Commission to review and repeal or modify regulations applicable to providers of 
telecommunications services that are determined to be no longer necessary in the public interest. 
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
a) Effective Competition Orders
140. Under the 1992 Cable Act and the Commission's implementing rules, only cable 
systems that are not subject to effective competition may be regulated under the cable rate 
rules.   Cable systems that are subject to effective competition are not rate regulated.  A cable 
operator that believes that it should not be subjected to the cable rate rules must file a petition 
with the Commission showing that it is subject to effective competition in its franchise area.   
Since 1992, the Cable Services Bureau has addressed over 200 effective competition petitions.  
b) Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act 
141. Recent amendments to the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) 
give consumers more choices in how they receive broadcast stations at home.   Most 
significantly, the amendments give satellite carriers the right to retransmit local stations back into 
local markets.  The legislation directs the Commission to conduct numerous rulemakings and 
inquiries within one year, including retransmission consent and must carry requirements for 
satellite carriers; network non-duplication; sports blackout and syndicated exclusivity; 
improvement of predictive models; enforcement procedures; designation of signal testers and an 
inquiry into signal standards.   The Commission has already issued five Orders, four Notices of 
Proposed Rulemaking and a Notice of Inquiry addressing SHVIA requirements.  The Cable 
Services Bureau continues work on additional SHVIA requirements.
c) Horizontal Ownership
142.  Section 613 (f)(1)(A) of the Communications Act requires the Commission to 
"prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers 
a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such a person, or in which such a 
person has an attributable interest."   The rules adopted by the Commission in response to 
613(f)(1)(A) are known as the horizontal ownership rules. 
143. The Third Report and Order adopted by the Commission in October 1999, inter 
alia, permits cable operators to have no more than a 30 percent share of nationwide multichannel 
video programming distributor (MVPD) subscribers.  The United States Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld the constitutionality of section 613(f)(1)(A).  A 
petition for reconsideration of the Third Report and Order was filed on January 3, 2000.  A 
decision on the petition is pending.  In addition, several cable operators filed petitions for review 
of the Third Report and Order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit.  These petitions are pending. 
d) Mandatory Carriage of Digital Television Signals 
144.  Local television stations receive access to a cable operator's cable system either 
through request, as with must carry, or through negotiation, as with retransmission consent.  
Sections 614 and 615 of the Communications Act contain the must carry requirements for 
commercial and noncommercial television stations, respectively.  Commercial television stations 
may invoke mandatory carriage rights within their local market areas.  Noncommercial television 
stations are considered qualified, and may invoke such rights if they (1) are licensed to a 
community within fifty miles of the principal headend of the cable system; or (2) place a Grade B 
contour over the cable operator's principal headend.  Low power television stations have rights to 
invoke mandatory carriage if they meet six qualifying statutory criteria; however, a cable operator 
cannot carry a low power station in lieu of a full power station. 
145. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, instructs 
the Commission to commence a proceeding to determine whether changes in the mandatory 
carriage rules are necessary to accommodate advances in television broadcast signal standards, 
such as the advent of digital broadcast television signals on cable television systems.   In 1995 
and 1996, the Commission received comments on digital television signal carriages issues from 
broadcasters, cable operators, cable programmers, equipment manufacturers, public interest 
groups and other interested parties in response to questions posed in the Fourth Further Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket 87-268.  To refresh the record and reflect recent changes in 
technology, policy and law, the Commission released a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 
July 1998 asking for new and updated information and arguments. 
e) Navigation Devices  
146. Navigation devices are television set-top boxes, converter boxes, interactive 
communications equipment, and other equipment that a consumer uses to access video 
programming.  The devices are most commonly recognized as the boxes on top of many 
televisions that are used to access cable television.  Section 629 of the 1996 Act requires the 
Commission to assure that navigation devices used in conjunction with multi channel 
programming distribution are commercially available from sources other than cable operators, 
e.g., made available to consumers through retail stores.  The Commission's rules relating to 
navigation devices are located at 47 C.F.R.  76.1200-1210.  In May 1999, the Commission 
adopted an Order on Reconsideration that exempted, as of July 1, 2000, equipment that performs 
analog-only conditional access from the requirement that multi-channel video programming 
distributors separate the security function from non-security functions.   The Commission did 
not think it worthwhile for the industry to construct a separate analog security module that will 
soon be obsolete because of the industry's transition from analog to digital programming.  The 
rules adopted were upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. 
f) Inside Wiring 
147. In October 1997, the Commission adopted a Report and Order and Second 
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that amended its cable inside wiring rules to enhance 
competition in the video distribution marketplace.   
148. The Report and Order was intended to provide opportunities for new entrants 
seeking to compete in distributing video programming, particularly multi-channel video 
programming distributors seeking to provide service in multi-dwelling unit buildings (MDUs).  
Specifically, the Commission's rules establish procedures for the disposition of cable "home run" 
wiring where the incumbent MVPD no longer has a legally enforceable right to remain in the 
building.   The Second Further Notice seeks comment on the benefits or disadvantages of 
exclusive contracts in promoting a competitive environment, and whether there are circumstances 
where the Commission should adopt restrictions on exclusive contracts in order to further 
promote competition in the MDU marketplace.   
2. New Initiatives
149. The Cable Services Bureau's review of the existing rules and procedures 
suggests a number of areas that should benefit from further review.  First, the Bureau has 
suggested and the Commission has adopted a proposal to revise the rules governing the filing of 
applications and forms to facilitate electronic filing.  The Cable Operations and Licensing System 
(COALS), a new electronic filing system, should significantly enhance availability of cable 
system information to the cable industry and the public, and reduce the cost of filing applications 
and obtaining information.   
150. The Cable Services Bureau also recommends that the Commission conduct a 
general review of the rules to eliminate specific sections that are no longer relevant or correct in 
light of judicial decisions or the elimination of certain statutory requirements.  Included in this 
category of changes would be: (1) the elimination of those portions of the rate rules pertaining to 
cable programming services tier (non-basic) rates which, pursuant to section 623(c)(4), sunset on 
April 1, 1999; (2) elimination of the rules based on section 505 of the 1996 Act, including section 
76.227, relating to incompletely scrambled sexually-oriented programming that were found to be 
unconstitutional by the recent Supreme Court decision in United States v. Playboy Entertainment 
Group, Inc., No. 96-1682 (decided May 22, 2000);  and (3) deletion of section 76.209, applying 
the fairness doctrine to cablecast programming.  
151. As part of the Biennial Regulatory Review Process, the Cable Services Bureau 
met with several attorneys who work with cable issues and other industry representatives.  In 
these meetings, the Bureau staff sought to obtain an outside perspective as to how the cable rules 
could be modified to serve the public better as competition in the industry develops.  As a result 
of these discussions, the bureau will be considering other changes to the rules, including in 
particular changes in the remaining rate rules on the basic service tier to make sure that the 
process continues to function properly and efficiently after elimination of cable programming 
service tier regulation.
B. Consumer Information Bureau 
152. The Consumer Information Bureau (CIB), which was created in November 1999 
along with the new Enforcement Bureau, was established to provide easy access to information 
about communications services, as well as to serve as a consumer and disability rights voice at 
the Commission.  CIB's creation consolidated consumer information and complaint processing 
responsibilities from multiple bureaus, thus eliminating duplication of services and providing 
consumers with a single point of contact with the FCC.
153. A key priority of CIB is to help ensure that information is readily available, 
because competitive markets work best when consumers have the information required to make 
informed choices.  CIB develops, recommends, coordinates and administers the Commission's 
consumer information program to enhance the public's understanding of the Commission's 
policies, goals, objectives, and regulatory requirements.  This serves to facilitate public 
participation in the Commission's proceedings.  
154. CIB's Reference Information Center (RIC) is the official Commission custodian 
for designated records, and handles the intake processing, organization and maintenance, 
reference services, retirement, and retrieval of these records.  It provides a convenient one-stop 
shop for its clients, including industry, attorneys, academic researchers and consumers, to 
research and obtain relevant and available information.  RIC is also responsible for managing and 
maintaining the Electronic Comment Filing System.  This system, which allows comments to be 
filed with the Commission remotely, facilitates public participation in Commission proceedings.
155. CIB has two consumer centers, one in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the other 
located at the FCC's Portals headquarters.  These centers, which comprise the Consumer 
Information Network Division (CIND), respond to over 100,000 consumer inquiries each year, 
and process and serve informal complaints.
156. CIB's Strategic Information Office (SIO) is charged with collecting and 
analyzing information received in the bureau from incoming consumer complaints and inquiries, 
consumer fora, and other industry sources.  This allows SIO to serve as an early warning system 
to the Commission about consumer trends.
157. Finally, CIB also contains the Disability Rights Office (DRO).  DRO advises 
other Bureaus and Offices on rulemakings and other proceedings.  It also helps consumers resolve 
disability complaints, and works with industry and other entities to facilitate the provision of 
accessible services and equipment.
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
158. CIB's Consumer Education Office (CEO) furthers the Bureau's mission to 
educate the public about important Commission regulatory programs, through consumer and 
industry fora and workshops.  CEO held a workshop to facilitate discussions between industry 
groups, state agencies, and consumer groups to make billing practices more consumer friendly.   
It has also published a guidebook on how consumers can participate in Commission proceedings, 
and consumer education pamphlets on selecting the right telephone service plan, and how to 
understand long-distance and dial-around advertising. 
159. In conjunction with other Commission bureaus and offices, CEO continues to 
develop consumer alerts, education campaigns and public service announcements to give 
consumers information about their rights and information so that they can protect themselves 
against unscrupulous practices.  CEO also held a forum on customer service,  featuring bureau 
staff, staff regulators, consumer and community representatives, and customer service experts.  
The forum was accompanied by a consumer education pamphlet on navigating customer service 
systems.  The Bureau is also planning a forum on the consumer perspective in a detariffed long 
distance market. 
160. CIB staff is working on the Commission's tribal initiatives to address the 
problem of limited availability of basic and advanced services in many tribal regions, and to 
ensure that basic and advanced telecommunications services are made available in those 
geographical areas.  CIB will continue to work on other outreach initiatives to underserved 
communities.
161. These non-regulatory initiatives will educate consumers so that they can make 
better, more informed choices about telecommunications services, and more fully enjoy the fruits 
of competitive markets.
2. New Initiatives
162. The staff recommends that the Commission consider reviewing its informal 
complaint rules, 47 C.F.R. 1.716-718.  The rules do not specify the documentation consumers 
must file with the Commission to complete their complaints, leading to repetitive filings from 
consumers, particularly if the primary filing lacks sufficient information to resolve the informal 
complaint.  The rules also do not prescribe a specific time frame for carriers to respond to an 
informal complaint.  If consumers have not received a response to an informal complaint in a 
specific period of time, consumers may file duplicative formal complaints.  Such complaints are 
costly to consumers and carriers, and may require unnecessary expenditure of Commission 
resources.  Finally, these rules traditionally have applied to informal wireline complaints, while 
other complaints have been handled in a less structured manner.  This has led to a lack of 
predictability for consumers in filing complaints, and industry in receiving complaints.  Staff 
recommends reviewing these rules, to determine whether their scope should be expanded to cover 
all informal complaints.
163. DRO advises other bureaus and offices on compliance with section 255 of the 
1996 Act, which mandates access to telecommunications services for Americans with disabilities, 
as well as other substantive proceedings addressing disability issues.  For example, DRO worked 
closely with the Common Carrier Bureau on drafting new rules relating to Telephone Relay 
Services (TRS).  These new rules require that speech-to-speech relay service be provided, and 
also encourage competition in the video relay market by making that service eligible for 
reimbursement from the TRS fund.  DRO intends to initiate rulemakings in the future on 
appropriate issues in order to fulfill its mandate.  Staff has also worked with the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau on the Commission's E-911 rules to ensure that these public safety 
rules are accessible to Americans with disabilities.  
164. DRO also conducts public outreach and education on disability issues.  It works 
closely with the public to ensure that individuals with disabilities are aware of their rights, and 
with industry to ensure that service providers are complying with the law and providing 
appropriate telecommunications services.  
165. Our education efforts included a TRS forum in March 2000,  which presented 
an opportunity for consumers and industry representatives to exchange ideas with the 
Commission and state relay administrators about provision of TRS, common concerns of TRS 
administrators, consumers, and providers, and variations among states' approaches to TRS.  The 
forum also discussed whether other technologies, services, and features should be made available 
to TRS users.
166. DRO also provides materials in accessible alternative formats, so individuals 
with disabilities have access to Commission proceedings, and has created an e-mail mailing list to 
keep consumers apprised of relevant happenings at the Commission.
C. Enforcement Bureau
167. The Commission established the Enforcement Bureau in November 1999.  The 
new Enforcement Bureau has responsibility for ensuring that regulated entities comply with the 
Communications Act and the Commission's implementing rules.  The consolidation of most 
enforcement functions into one bureau is consistent with the regulatory reform goals of section 
11, because it makes it easier for competitors and consumers to get prompt and clear resolution of 
disputes.  Consolidating enforcement activity into a single bureau promotes consistent and 
predictable enforcement policies.  It also maximizes the efficiency of the Commission's 
enforcement program by allowing the agency to establish enforcement priorities and make the 
best use of limited Commission resources.
168. Clear, consistent and swift enforcement action is increasingly important as 
competition develops and deregulation occurs.  The statutory and rule provisions that remain will 
be those that are necessary even in a competitive environment, such as those that provide a 
structure for competition to flourish, help users of communications services benefit from 
competitive communications services, and ensure that spectrum is used in a manner that prevents 
harmful interference and promotes public safety.  In particular, the Enforcement Bureau is a 
critical part of the agency's plan to preserve and promote the competitive gains that have been 
made under the 1996 Act and the Commission's implementing regulations.  To ensure fair 
competition, all competitors must play by the rules and follow the law.  Companies may not gain 
a competitive advantage through unfair market practices.  With the enhanced focus on 
enforcement, companies know that, if they violate communications law or the Commission's 
rules, there will be significant consequences.  In this way, the competitive marketplace envisioned 
by Congress will work, and the benefits of that competition will flow to consumers.
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
169. Although the Enforcement Bureau generally does not engage in rulemaking 
activity or have responsibility for maintaining or revising substantive Commission rules, the 
agency has taken steps during the past few years in the area of enforcement to further the 
deregulatory goals of the 1996 Act.  For example, the Commission revamped and streamlined its 
procedural rules governing the resolution of formal complaints against common carriers filed 
pursuant to section 208 of the Communications Act.  These changes were designed to resolve 
disputes more quickly and efficiently than under prior rules.
170. Most significantly, under the new rules Enforcement Bureau staff has stepped up 
its efforts to mediate disputes between the parties both before and after a formal complaint is filed 
at the Commission.  These mediation efforts often result in quick and efficient resolution of 
disputes.  Business solutions achieved by the parties through Commission-assisted mediation 
avoid the expense and delay that can accompany formal litigation before the agency.
171. The revised rules also require that a complaining party provide all factual support 
for its case in its initial pleadings.  This minimizes the need for time-consuming and resource-
intensive discovery.  In addition, the rules provide for the staff to convene an initial status 
conference with the parties shortly after the defendant files its answer.  This presents an 
opportunity to simplify or narrow the issues, obtain admissions of fact or stipulations by the 
parties, settle some or all of the matters in controversy, and develop a schedule for the remainder 
of the case.  This proactive case management tool helps ensure prompt and efficient case 
resolution.
172. In addition, the agency created an Accelerated Docket procedure in 1998 that 
results in quicker formal decisions from the agency for certain formal complaints selected by 
Bureau staff.  Once a particular dispute is accepted by the staff onto the Accelerated Docket, the 
procedure is designed to lead to a written staff-level decision within 60 days from the filing of the 
complaint.  Because this procedure may lead to a "mini-trial" with testimony by witnesses subject 
to cross-examination, it is particularly well suited for cases involving difficult factual disputes.  
The Accelerated Docket rules require staff-supervised pre-filing settlement discussions between 
the parties.  Many disputes are settled without the need to file a formal complaint.
173. The efficiencies generated by the new complaint procedures, combined with an 
increased emphasis on mediation and aggressive case management, have resulted in a significant 
reduction in the number of pending formal common carrier complaints at the Commission.  By 
reducing the backlog of pending cases, the staff can respond more quickly to new disputes as they 
are filed and resolve them in a timely fashion.  Quick and clear resolution of disputes is critical to 
enhancing competition and enabling consumers to obtain the benefits of that competition.
D. Office Of Communications Business Opportunities
174. Section 257(c) of the Communications Act  requires the Commission to report 
triennially to Congress on the steps taken to eliminate market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and 
other small businesses in telecommunications.  Section 257 was enacted as part of the 1996 Act  
and focuses on two areas:  (1) "the provision and ownership of telecommunications services and 
information services" and (2) "the provision of parts or services to providers of 
telecommunications services and information services."   Pursuant to the requirements of 
section 257, the Commission, in 1996, initiated a proceeding  to identify market entry barriers.  
In 1997 the Commission issued a report ("1997 Report")  referencing the policy objectives set 
forth in section 257 - "favoring [1] diversity of media voices, [2] vigorous economic competition, 
[3] technological advancement, and [4] promotion of the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity"  - and describing a variety of measures taken by the Commission to fulfill those 
policies.  
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
175. The Commission has just completed its second report under section 257 ("2000 
Report").  The 2000 Report, which was delivered to Congress August 9, 2000, reflects the 
Commission's continuing compliance with the four policy objectives set forth supra.  The report 
sets forth the Commission's Five-Year Strategic Plan and the role of that plan in eliminating 
market entry barriers.  Following the discussion of the strategic plan, the bulk of the 2000 Report 
describes regulatory and other initiatives undertaken by the Commission's bureaus and offices 
since 1997 to remove market entry barriers and other impediments confronting small businesses.  
The report also analyzes efforts to overcome unique obstacles facing minority-owned and 
women-owned small businesses, discusses this Biennial Regulatory Review, addresses 
responsibilities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Act,  and 
introduces the agency's new electronic filing systems.  Finally, the report sets forth some 
proposed legislative initiatives.  The 2000 Report is available to the public on the Commission's 
website at http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OCBO/fcc00279.html.
176. RFA Analyses and Certifications Since enactment of the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 ("SBREFA") amendments  to the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act,   the Commission has strived to make its RFA analyses more extensive, precise, 
and helpful, and to include a focus on plain language.  For instance, because the agency typically 
writes rulemakings tailored to the various and numerous communications "services" it regulates 
(e.g., FM radio, paging, satellite services, etc.), the agency has undertaken numerous RFA 
analyses describing each service and the extent of the small entity participation within each.  This 
has required frequent revision of the service sector analyses, as new services are created and 
additional licenses for traditional services are issued.  In this way, the agency attempts to ensure 
full and accurate analyses and certifications in the agency's 150 or more rulemaking items per 
year.  
177. Special initiatives.  Special initiatives have included internal training sessions 
for Commission staff on the RFA process and, a special RFA presentation conducted by the 
Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Office of Advocacy to train Commission staff.  The 
presentation was held on October 12, 1999, and featured the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy.  
Going forward, the FCC is committed to working with SBA and the small business community to 
develop regulatory policies and procedures that are no more burdensome than necessary to 
achieve the intended goals.  Another 1999 initiative was the resolution of the Commission's 
treatment of small incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) under the RFA.  In the 1997 Report, 
the Commission stated that it did not believe that small incumbent LECs qualified as small 
businesses under the RFA because such businesses appeared to be "dominant in their field or 
operation due to their current control of bottleneck facilities."   Following a letter on the subject 
from the Office of Advocacy and a meeting between agency staffs, the Commission decided to 
revise the language of its decisions to make clear that small incumbent LECs are among the small 
businesses included in its analyses under the RFA.   
178. Annual "Ten-Year Review of Rules," 5 U.S.C.  610.  During 1999, the 
Commission completed and published an updated, comprehensive listing of Commission rule 
sections subject to review under the RFA's annual "ten-year review of rules" provision, 5 U.S.C. 
 610.  Section 610 requires that agencies publish in the Federal Register a plan for the periodic 
review of rules that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  
The recent Commission plan provides a list of hundreds of rules in an effort to assist the public in 
identifying rules that might be amended or rescinded in the public interest.  In addition, the 
Commission has explored the creation of a computer software program that, utilizing historical 
Code of Federal Regulations data, would track rules over a ten-year period and significantly 
reduce the administrative work currently required to undertake a section 610 review.  If the 
Commission were to accomplish this goal, it could share the computer program with other federal 
agencies subject to section 610 obligations, thereby assisting those agencies as well.  
179. Special Small Business Size Standards, 15 U.S.C.  632.  To ensure that the 
agency's initiatives accurately target small entity participation in the telecommunications 
industry, the Commission works closely with the SBA's Office of Size Standards to create new 
telecommunications small business size standards.  In particular, in recent years, the agency has 
coordinated extensively with both the SBA Office of Size Standards and the Office of Advocacy 
to create informal guidelines to keep the SBA apprised of size standard initiatives.  The 
Commission's policy is to send SBA descriptions and analyses of proposed size standards prior to 
adoption of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in such proceedings, and thereafter to send to the 
SBA additional comments and documentation at each step of the way.  At the end of the process, 
the Commission sends a formal request for approval to the SBA Administrator, prior to final 
Commission consideration of the new size standard.  This close coordination has particularly 
helped the Commission to initiate radio spectrum auctions, where the goals are to make efficient 
use of the spectrum, give all Americans access to telecommunications services, and promote 
economic growth.  
180. Semi-annual "Unified Agenda," 5 U.S.C.  602.  The Commission participates 
in the semi-annual publication of the "Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory 
Actions," which provides information, in a uniform format, about regulations that the government 
is considering or reviewing.   The Unified Agenda has appeared in the Federal Register twice 
each year since 1983.  It helps agencies comply with certain obligations under the RFA, other 
statutes, and Executive Orders.  As a part of the October 1999 Unified Agenda compilation, the 
Commission listed and described 128 ongoing rulemaking proceedings.  These descriptions assist 
the public in becoming involved in the regulatory process, and assist the regulated community in 
complying with existing regulation.
E. Office of Engineering and Technology
181. The Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), in addition to providing 
technical and engineering support to all of the bureaus and offices, has primary responsibility for 
the management and allocation of non-government spectrum, the authorization of 
telecommunications equipment and RF regulated devices, and the administration of the 
Experimental Radio Service.  OET has specific responsibility for Parts 2, 5, 15 and 18 of the 
Commission's Rules.    All of the rules governing these responsibilities were reviewed by staff.  
OET sought recommendations regarding rules and procedures that should be modified or 
eliminated.
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
182. OET has responsibility for authorizing radio frequency equipment and devices 
and has endeavored in the past several years to privatize and standardize this work.  In addition to 
instituting electronic filing and streamlining the experimental radio service  and equipment 
authorization rules and processes,  the Commission modified the equipment authorization rules 
to allow designated private parties to issue equipment authorizations.   The Commission has 
also worked diligently to implement Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs), which permit 
designated parties in other countries to issue equipment authorizations.   
183. Through various spectrum management efforts, the Commission has endeavored 
to facilitate new, innovative and competitive services.  Specifically, the Commission has 
facilitated the proliferation of unlicensed services through the allocation of spectrum for the 
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) and authorization of UNII devices.    
These devices provide short-range, high-speed wireless digital communications that support 
wireless local area networks and facilitate wireless access to the national information 
infrastructure.  The Commission has also allocated millimeter wave spectrum for unlicensed 
devices that provide short-range communications.    These unlicensed devices can be used for 
such diverse services as vehicle radar systems for collision avoidance, computer-to-computer 
wireless connections, and improved access to libraries and information databases.  The 
Commission has proposed to revise its rules for spread spectrum devices to facilitate the 
development of new and innovative technology that is often used for high data rate wireless 
applications.   The Commission recently proposed the possibility of permitting operation of one 
of the newest innovative wireless technologies, ultra-wideband technology.   This new 
technology can be used for a variety of applications such as radar imaging of objects under the 
ground or behind walls, and for wireless communications such as short-range high-speed data 
transmissions suitable for broadband access to the Internet.  
184. In addition to unlicensed spectrum, the Commission allocated spectrum for 
Dedicated Short Range communications systems operating in the Intelligent Transportation 
System radio service.   These services and systems can provide short range wireless information 
links between vehicles and roadside systems, and can improve traveler safety, decrease traffic 
congestion, facilitate the reduction of air pollution and help conserve fossil fuels.  Very recently, 
the Commission allocated spectrum for a new wireless medical telemetry service and established 
service rules that provide interference protection for the potentially life critical equipment used in 
hospitals and health care facilities that transmit patient measurement data such as pulse and 
respiration rates to nearby receivers.   The Commission has proposed allocating spectrum for 
fixed wireless access service which could be used to provide wireless local exchange and 
exchange access service.   The Commission also issued a Policy Statement articulating the 
principles that will guide the Commission's reallocation of approximately 200 MHz of spectrum 
over the next three to five years.    This spectrum will enable a broad range of new radio 
communications services, such as expanded wireless services, advanced mobile services, and new 
spectrum-efficient private land mobile systems.
185. With these new spectrum allocations, rules and principles, the Commission 
anticipates the development of a broad range of new devices and communications options that 
will stimulate economic development and the growth of new industries and promote the ability of 
manufacturers, including small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete both domestically and 
globally.  
186. The Commission very recently began an inquiry to obtain more information 
about software defined radios.   In a software defined radio, functions formerly performed 
solely in hardware are performed by software.  This innovation, which makes a radio 
programmable, could facilitate interoperability between radio services, improve efficient use of 
spectrum, expand opportunities for broadband communication access for all persons, increase 
competition among telecommunications service providers, decrease equipment costs for 
consumers, and increase worldwide market opportunities for US manufacturer of all sizes.  
187. As follow-ups to proceedings initiated as part of OET's 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review efforts, the Commission proposed changes to its rules regarding conducted 
emission limits in Parts 15 and 18 of the rules  to make them more effective in controlling 
interference to communications services and to reduce the burden of these regulations.  Review of 
the rules regulating radio frequency lighting devices resulted in the relaxation of the line-
conducted emission limits in Part 18 of the rules for RF lighting devices operating in the 2.2-2.8 
MHz band.   The Commission is continuing to examine the possible relaxation of the rules for 
RF lighting devices operating in the 2450 MHz band. 
2. New Initiatives
188. As part of the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review process, the Commission 
recently proposed to streamline the process of developing technical criteria for customer premises 
equipment and to privatize the customer premises equipment approval process.   These 
proposals are intended to promote competition in the provision of telecommunications products 
and electronic equipment, speed delivery of products to the public and ensure market access in 
other countries. 
189. The Commission has rules that restrict human exposure to radio frequency (RF) 
emissions in radio devices.  Currently, radio devices such as cellular and PCS telephones 
manufactured and marketed in the United States must meet certain requirements regarding RF 
emissions.  Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is a measure of human exposure to radio signals.  
Notwithstanding intensive efforts both domestically and internationally by private standards-
setting organizations, SAR measurement techniques are not currently standardized.  Staff 
recommend that the Commission take steps to facilitate development of standardized SAR 
measurement techniques.  A standard SAR measurement procedure can make the already 
dynamic market for such equipment even more dynamic by increasing alternatives for approval, 
and improving the speed and predictability of the approval process. 
190. The industry standard setting committee ANSI C63 recently developed an 
equipment testing procedure for unlicensed PCS systems.   The new procedure, C.63.4, removes 
ambiguities in the test procedure.  The staff recommends incorporating the new standard into the 
Commission's rules by reference in order to update current test procedures.
191. The explosive growth in the international market for mobile communications 
devices such as cellular and PCS phones and marine and aviation devices has resulted in the 
manufacture of products that operate in dual modes or on frequencies not authorized for such 
operation in every country where the products are marketed.  When such products are approved 
for sale in the United States, our rules are ambiguous as to whether the product complies with 
standards applicable for operation in international markets.  The staff recommends this ambiguity 
be resolved and Commission rules clarify whether dual mode products approved in the United 
States must comply with other applicable international standards.
192. In the past decade commercial utilization of spectrum above 2 GHz has increased 
significantly.  Licensed and unlicensed devices operating above 2 GHz have proliferated, in part 
because technical advances have made such devices affordable.  When the Commission first 
authorized services and devices in this spectrum, radiated emission limits were established.  At 
that time, the Commission had a significant accumulation of information on emissions below 2 
GHz, but very little information on emissions above 2 GHz.  Emission limits affect the design and 
performance of devices, and prevent interference among devices.  However, unnecessarily 
restrictive limits can impede innovation and development of new markets.  Accordingly, the staff 
recommends reviewing Commission rules on intentional and unintentional emission limits above 
2 GHz to determine whether the limits are appropriate.
193. Current Commission rules prohibit unlicensed "periodic" (intermittent) 
transmitters at 40 MHz and above 70 MHz from transmitting continuous data signals.   The 
original rationale for this prohibition was that efficient utilization of the spectrum by multiple 
users was facilitated by limiting the amount of data transmissions within the band.  Use of current 
technology, however, results in the opposite conclusion.  The staff believes this rule can be 
updated to permit data transmissions and enable some new types of unlicensed wireless systems 
without changing the effect and intent of the original rule.
194. At present, the highest electromagnetic radio-frequency spectrum for which 
commercial service rules exist is 77 GHz.  As a result of a program of the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, semiconductor device technology at 92-95 GHz is now available.  
Propagation in this band is relatively good, compared to other nearby frequencies, due to limited 
radio absorption by oxygen molecules.  The short wavelengths generated in this "oxygen 
window" band can be effectively utilized by very small narrow beam antennas for high speed 
transmissions and high frequency reuse.  The staff recommends exploring possible use of this 
band, including seeking initial inquiry on whether the band is appropriate for licensed or 
unlicensed use and for shared commercial and Government use.   
3. Other Issues
195. The staff's thorough review of the Commission's allocation and standards rules 
revealed a handful of rules adopted some time ago that address legacy systems or demographic 
locations that have changed significantly.  Some of these rules or standards were instituted at the 
behest of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration at the Department of 
Commerce, acting pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  305 on behalf of the Executive Branch, to protect 
Federal Government systems.  The staff recommends revisiting with NTIA whether certain 
restrictions on non-government systems remain necessary. 
196. In 1983, the Commission reviewed all of the technical rules to identify rules that 
might unnecessarily discourage technical innovation.    In view of the tremendous growth and 
innovation in telecommunications and radio systems and devices over the past decade, technical 
rules that are design-based as opposed to performance-based could be thwarting innovation and 
growth.  Accordingly, the staff recommends that technical staff for OET, working with technical 
staff from the other Bureaus and Offices, again review the technical rules to ensure they permit 
flexibility while preventing interference and ensuring spectrum efficiency.
F. Office of General Counsel
197. The Office of General Counsel (OGC) advises, makes recommendations, and 
defends the Commission regarding legal issues that arise in a wide range of Commission 
activities.  OGC does not have primary responsibility for drafting or overseeing compliance with 
substantive Commission rules, but it does recommend and oversee compliance with a variety of 
procedural rules.  For example, OGC is involved in setting procedures for rulemakings, hearings, 
and other proceedings.  These rules are included in Parts 0 and 1 of Title 47 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations.
198. OGC is committed to establishing processes that encourage participation by a 
broad a range of interested parties, in a convenient manner, and without unnecessary expense.  At 
the same time, OGC works to ensure that the Commission's procedures conform to the notice and 
comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and that parties have access 
to comments and other information that the Commission may consider in making its decisions.
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
199. In 1997, the Commission revised its rules governing ex parte presentations in 
Commission proceedings.   Those revisions were intended to make the rules simpler and clearer.  
In 1999, the Commission found that, although its experience with the revised rules generally was 
positive, further minor revisions were warranted.   The Commission modified its rules regarding 
which persons would be treated as parties for purposes of determining ex parte status.  The 
Commission also changed the ex parte status of certain types of proceedings from restricted to 
permit-but-disclose.  The Commission determined that presentations to Commission 
representatives by administrators, such as the Universal Service Administrative Company (i.e., 
the entity that administers universal service), would be exempt.  In addition, a person seeking 
Commission preemption is required to serve its preemption request upon any state or local 
government identified in the request.  These revisions were intended to further simplify and 
clarify the Commission's ex parte rules, enhance the fairness of the Commission's processes, and 
facilitate the public's ability to communicate with the Commission.
200. In 1998, the Commission revised its rules and clarified its policies concerning the 
treatment of competitively sensitive information that carriers and others provide to the 
Commission.  The Commission adopted a model protective order for use in its proceedings. 
G. Office of the Managing Director
201. The Office of the Managing Director (OMD) provides management and 
administrative support to the Commission's bureaus and offices.  It administers management and 
administrative policy programs and directives supporting the deregulatory efforts of bureaus and 
offices and their goals to increase competition.  The rules administered by OMD do not regulate 
telecommunications service providers directly.  Traditionally, however, OMD has exercised 
jurisdiction over certain portions of Parts 0, 1, and 3 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations.  OMD staff conducted a review of these regulations to determine whether to 
recommend that any of these rules be repealed or modified. 
202. Initially, staff determined whether a section of the Communications Act was 
involved.  For example, Part 0 contains the Commission's rules implementing the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act, and Part 1 contains rules implementing the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) and the Ethics in Government Act.  Other government 
agencies have primary responsibility for implementing these statutes.  Therefore, the staff did not 
recommend changes to these rules.  The staff reviewed rules based on the Communications Act to 
determine whether enactment of the 1996 Act affected the operation of these rules, and whether 
there had been any significant market changes or other developments that might affect the current 
rules and warrant modification or repeal. 
203. As the Commission proceeds with its organization, OMD will continue to 
support bureaus and offices to ensure that its organization leads to increased efficiency and 
effectiveness.  OMD will conduct annual reviews and will perform verifications as required.  
Oversight of accounting procedures will also continue.  OMD will regularly evaluate its rules to 
determine whether they should be modified or eliminated in light of changing competitive market 
conditions.
1. Recent and Ongoing Activities
204. Part 0 covers the organization and general description of the Commission's 
organization and operations.  This section concerns regulations pertaining to the administrative 
functions of the different bureaus and offices, delegations of authority to the Commissioners, 
bureaus and offices, the operation of the public reference rooms, and the agency's printed 
publications.  Generally, these rules are amended whenever there is a reorganization.  The 
Commission periodically reviews its organizational structure to ensure that it provides for the 
most efficient and effective structure for the Commission's functions.  The Commission amended 
rules implementing the FOIA to reflect the Electronic Freedom of Information Act,  but the 
rules may require further updating to reflect the restructuring of reference room operations 
following the move to the Portals and the availability of public records on the agency's Internet 
website.
205. Part 1, subpart A involves pleadings, filing periods, and motions for extension of 
time.  These rules are administered by Office of the Secretary.  The Commission recently made 
minor changes to some of these rules, and staff does not recommend further changes at this 
time.  Part 1 also covers statutory charges and procedures for payment of fees.  These sections 
are reviewed annually and in some cases biannually, pursuant to the Communications Act. 
206. Part 3 involves the certification and monitoring of accounting authorities.  The 
Associate Managing Director for Financial Operations recently revised these rules to reflect the 
Commission's new location.  Last year the Commission modified these rules to phase out the 
Commission's Accounting Authority [US01] and to privatize this function. 
2. New Initiatives
207. In August 1999, FCC Chairman William Kennard delivered to Congress the 
FCC's Strategic Plan for the 21st Century.  The Strategic Plan has as one of its goals to "Create a 
Model Agency for the Digital Age.   One of the objectives under this goal is for the agency to 
"Lead the Way in the Information Age."  The Office of the Managing Director seeks to meet this 
objective through the development and implementation of an intelligent, integrated, information 
management system known as the "Intelligent Gateway" or "Gateway."  The "Gateway" will help 
the FCC develop its website into a model of accessibility and information availability.  
208. Once funded, designed, and implemented, the Gateway will ensure swift, 
accurate, and complete access to information by the public, and will promote information sharing 
among the Bureaus and Offices.  As a result, the agency will reduce duplicative staff efforts and 
will make available, in ways useful for both internal and external consumption, information about 
the number and priority of its pending tasks.  
209. At least one industry group has expressed an interest in the public tracking of 
items on circulation before the Commission.  As the Gateway develops, we recommend that the 
Commission consider whether to use it to permit the public to track items as they move through 
the Commission, prior to adoption. 
210. The Office of Management and Budget has directed federal agencies under the 
Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) to implement procedures that allow individuals 
or entities the option to submit information or transact with Federal Agencies electronically, when 
practicable, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable.  GPEA also includes an 
electronic signature mechanism to provide verification and security for documents.  The 
Performance Evaluation and Records Management Office is in the process of implementing these 
procedures.
211. The Commission is in the process of implementing an on line registration system, 
the Commission Registration System (CORES), for all entities filing applications or making 
payments to the Commission.  Over time, the CORES registration number will be used by all 
Commission systems that handle financial, authorization of service and enforcement activities.  
CORES will provide the means for the Commission to administer more effectively its financial 
management responsibilities.

APPENDIX IV: RULE PART ANALYSIS
PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
Description
Part 1 contains rules governing general practice and procedure before the Commission, including 
rules and procedures governing applications and licensing, rulemakings, complaints, hearings, 
and a variety of other Commission processes.  Part 1 also contains miscellaneous rules 
implementing certain statutes other than the Communications Act that affect Commission 
processes, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.  Some of these rules apply generally to all entities that conduct 
business before the Commission, others apply to specific groups of licensees or other regulated 
entities, while others apply solely to the Commission and its staff.
Part 1 contains 19 subparts:  
Subpart A - General Rules of Practice and Procedure - General rules for filing of 
pleadings with and appearances before the Commission; procedures for miscellaneous 
Commission proceedings, including forfeitures, license modifications, revocation or 
cease and desist proceedings, consent orders, reconsiderations (other than 
reconsiderations in rulemaking proceedings), and applications for review.  
Subpart B - Hearing Proceedings - Procedural rules for hearing proceedings.
Subpart C - Rulemaking Proceedings - Procedural rules for rulemaking proceedings.
Subpart D - Broadcast Applications and Proceedings
Subpart E - Complaints, Applications, Tariffs, and Reports Involving Common Carriers 
- Procedural rules pertaining to filings by and complaints against common carriers. 
Subpart F - Wireless Telecommunications Services Applications and Procedures - 
Application and licensing rules for wireless services. 
Subpart G - Schedule of Statutory Charges and Procedures - Fee schedule for application 
and regulatory fees charged by the Commission, pursuant to sections 8 and 9 of the 
Communications Act. 
Subpart H - Ex Parte Communications - Rules governing ex parte communications and 
presentations in Commission proceedings.  
Subpart I - Procedures Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA)  - Application and licensing rules for FCC-licensed facilities that require 
environmental clearance under NEPA due to potential impact on environmentally 
sensitive areas. 
Subpart J - Pole Attachment Complaint Procedures - Complaint procedures applicable to  
cable companies and telecommunications carriers that seek to obtain non-discriminatory 
access to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way on reasonable rates, terms, and 
conditions.  
Subpart K - Implementation of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) in Agency 
Proceedings  - Rules and procedures for parties to Commission administrative 
proceedings who seek recovery of attorneys fees and expenses pursuant to the EAJA.
Subpart L - Random Selection Procedures for Mass Media Services - Rules and 
procedures for use of lotteries to award certain categories of broadcast licenses.  [Not 
applicable to telecommunications carriers.]  
Subpart N - Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs or 
Activities Conducted by the Federal Communications Commission - Rules implementing 
the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Disabilities Amendments of 1978,  
which prohibits Executive agencies from discriminating against persons with disabilities 
in programs or activities conducted by the agency.  [Not applicable to 
telecommunications carriers.]
Subpart O - Collection of Claims Owed the United States - Rules allowing the 
Commission to collect certain debts owed to the United States through administrative or 
salary offsets.  
Subpart P - Implementation of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1998  - Rules requiring 
certain Commission applicants to certify that they are not subject to denial of Federal 
Benefits under section 5301 of the ADAA due to a conviction for possession or 
distribution of a controlled substance.
Subpart Q - Competitive Bidding Procedures - Rules governing the mechanisms and 
procedures for competitive bidding to award spectrum licenses.
Subpart R - Implementation of section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act: Procedures 
Concerning Acceptance of Unconditional Gifts, Donations, and Bequests - Rules 
restricting acceptance of gifts by Commission employees.  [Not applicable to 
telecommunications carriers.]
Subpart S - Preemption of Restrictions That "Impair" a Viewer's Ability to Receive 
Television Broadcast Signals, Direct Broadcast Satellites, or Multi-Channel Multipoint 
Distribution Services - Rules preempting state and local regulation of antennas for 
reception of video programming via broadcast, satellite, or multipoint distribution 
services.  [Not applicable to telecommunications carriers.]
Subpart T - Exempt Telecommunications Companies - Rules implementing provisions 
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by which a public utility holding company may 
obtain a determination from the Commission of status as an Exempt Telecommunications 
Company (ETC).
Purpose
The primary purpose of the Part 1 rules, particularly subparts A through L and subpart Q, is to 
establish fair and equitable rules of practice and procedure before the Commission for applicants, 
licensees, and other entities regulated by the Commission.  Other subparts of Part 1 serve other 
purposes, such as compliance with external statutory mandates.
Analysis
Advantages
The procedural rules in Part 1 provide uniform direction to applicants, licensees, and other 
entities in a wide variety of Commission proceedings.  Consolidation of the Commission's 
procedural rules in Part 1 helps to ensure consistency in the Commission's processes across 
services, Bureaus, and offices.  
Disadvantages
The Part 1 rules impose inherent administrative burdens on applicants, licensees, and other parties 
that practice before the Commission.  
Recent Efforts
Certain portions of the Part 1 rules, such as the wireless licensing rules (subpart F), the ex parte 
rules (subpart H), and the Commission's competitive bidding rules (subpart Q) have been 
revamped in recent rulemaking proceedings.   In addition, Part 1 was recently amended to allow 
parties to file comments and other pleadings electronically via the Internet in informal notice and 
comment rulemaking proceedings under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act.   In 
that Report and Order, the rules were also amended to permit electronic filing of all pleadings 
and comments in proceedings involving petitions for rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry 
proceedings.  Since that time, other Bureaus have amended Part 1 to include the electronic filing 
of applications. 
Recommendation
The Part 1 rules are essential to the orderly conduct of business before the Commission.  In 
addition, as noted above, key portions of Part 1 have been recently revamped.  The staff therefore 
recommends no significant changes to the Part 1 rules at this time.  However, as the Commission 
proceeds to implement new initiatives in the area of electronic filing, further amendment of the 
rules is envisioned.  In addition, the staff intends to closely monitor the practical application of 
these rules, and will recommend appropriate rule changes in the future if the rules no longer best 
achieve their underlying purposes.  [Note:  Staff recommendations with respect to certain 
subparts of Part 1 are discussed in the sections below.]

PART 1, SUBPART E - COMPLAINTS, APPLICATIONS, TARIFFS, AND REPORTS INVOLVING 
COMMON CARRIERS - FORMAL COMPLAINTS
Description
The rules governing formal complaints against common carriers implement section 208 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.   Section 208 permits any person to lodge a complaint 
with the Commission against a common carrier alleging a violation of the Communications Act.  
In addition, Congress amended the Communications Act in 1996, among other things, to establish 
specific procedures and, in some cases, timeframes for complaints concerning certain new 
statutory provisions.  See, for example, sections 260 (telemessaging), 271 (Bell operating 
company entry into long distance market), 274 (Bell operating company provision of electronic 
publishing service), 275 (Bell operating company provision of alarm monitoring service).  The 
Commission's formal complaint rules implement these new statutory provisions.
Purpose.
These rules establish procedures for Commission receipt and review of formal complaints lodged 
against common carriers.  The rules are designed to expedite the resolution of formal complaints 
while safeguarding the due process interests of the affected parties.  In addition, the rules are 
intended to foster the pro-competitive, deregulatory goals of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 
by providing for prompt and efficient enforcement of the statute and the Commission's 
substantive rules implementing the statute. 
Analysis.
Status of Competition
Because section 208 permits complaints against a wide range of common carriers involving a host 
of obligations, it is not feasible to characterize the status of competition with respect to the variety 
of common carriers and markets subject to this statutory provision.
Advantages 
The rules provide procedures to expedite resolution of disputes involving a common carrier.  As 
noted in the Staff Report, the rules permit and encourage staff-sponsored mediation between the 
parties both before and after a formal complaint is filed at the Commission.  These mediation 
efforts often result in quick and efficient resolution of disputes.  Business solutions achieved by 
the parties through Commission-assisted mediation avoid the expense and delay that can 
accompany formal litigation before the agency.
The rules also require that a complaining party provide all factual support for its case in its initial 
pleadings.  This, in turn, minimizes the need for time-consuming and resource-intensive 
discovery.  In addition, the rules provide for the staff to convene an initial status conference with 
the parties shortly after the defendant files its answer.  This present an opportunity to simplify or 
narrow the issues, obtain admissions of fact or stipulations by the parties, settle some or all of the 
matters in controversy, and develop a schedule for the remainder of the case.  This proactive case 
management tool helps ensure prompt and efficient case resolution.
Moreover, the rules provide an Accelerated Docket procedure that results in quicker formal 
decisions from the agency for certain formal complaints selected by the staff.  Once a particular 
dispute is accepted by the staff onto the Accelerated Docket, the procedure is designed to lead to 
a written staff-level decision within 60 days from the filing of the complaint.  Because this 
procedure may lead to a "mini-trial" with testimony by witnesses subject to cross-examination, it 
is particularly well suited for cases involving difficult factual issues.  The Accelerated Docket 
rules require staff-supervised pre-filing settlement discussions between the parties.  Thus, many 
disputes are settled without the need to file a formal complaint.
Disadvantages.
Formal litigation can be expensive and time-consuming.  The rules attempt to minimize these 
liabilities by enhancing mediation and limiting discovery, while recognizing the due process 
interests of the affected parties.  Nevertheless, section 208 creates a statutory process for persons 
to file complaints against common carriers and obligates the Commission to investigate those 
complaints, often within tight timeframes.  Procedural rules are thus necessary to discharge this 
statutory directive. 
Recent Efforts.
As noted in the Staff Report, the Commission revamped and streamlined these rules in 1997 and 
1998 in light of the pro-competitive, deregulatory goals of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  
The 1997 rule changes, in general, were designed to: (1) promote settlement efforts to enable 
parties to resolve disputes on their own; (2) improve the utility and content of pleadings; and (3) 
streamline the formal complaint process by eliminating or limiting procedural devices and 
pleading opportunities that contributed to undue delay.  The 1998 rule changes created the 
Accelerated Docket.  These specialized rules provide a framework for expeditious resolution of 
certain carrier-related complaints. 
Recommendation.  
The staff recommends no changes to the rules at this time because the rules were recently 
revamped and streamlined.  However, the staff intends to closely monitor the practical application 
of all the rules governing formal complaints against common carriers.  The staff will recommend 
appropriate rule changes in the future if the rules no longer achieve their underlying purposes, or 
if rule changes will better serve the public interest in light of competitive developments in the 
marketplace.

PART 1, SUBPART F - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES APPLICATIONS AND 
PROCEDURES
Description
Part 1, subpart F  sets forth procedural rules governing the filing of applications and the issuance 
of wireless licenses.  The rules cover all of the basic types of applications associated with 
wireless licensing, including initial applications, amendments and modifications, waiver requests, 
requests for special temporary authorization, assignment and transfer applications, and renewals.  
In addition, subpart F includes rules concerning public notices, petitions to deny, dismissal of 
applications, and termination of licenses.
The subpart F rules were adopted as part of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review in the 
Universal Licensing proceeding, WT Docket No. 98-20.   The Commission initiated this 
proceeding in connection with the implementation of the Universal Licensing System (ULS), an 
integrated, automated system for electronic filing and processing of wireless applications.  In the 
Universal Licensing proceeding, the Commission consolidated and streamlined its procedural 
rules into subpart F, which replaced numerous service-specific rules that had previously applied 
to different wireless services.  In addition, the Commission adopted new standardized application 
forms designed for use in ULS, and adopted rules requiring all wireless telecommunications 
carriers, as well as certain other classes of wireless licensees, to file applications electronically.   
Purpose
The purpose of subpart F is to:  (1) establish uniform procedures for the licensing of all wireless 
services; (2) minimize filing requirements by eliminating redundant, inconsistent, or unnecessary 
submissions; and (3) ensure the collection of reliable information from applicants and licensees.
Analysis
Advantages
Consolidating the wireless procedural rules into a single subpart provides greater clarity, 
consistency, and predictability to the licensing process than the prior array of sometimes 
inconsistent service-specific rules, forms, and procedures.  This lessens the filing burden on 
applicants, and also facilitates more rapid and efficient processing by the Commission. 
Disadvantages
The requirement of electronic filing for all wireless telecommunications carriers imposes certain 
technical burdens and costs.  In addition, the general procedural rules contained in subpart F 
impose administrative burdens on wireless applicants and licensees that are inherent to the 
licensing process.   
Recent Efforts
The Commission most recently reviewed the subpart F rules in its 1999 reconsideration of the 
ULS Report and Order, in which it made minor but not substantial changes to the rules.  
Recommendation
In light of the Commission's recent adoption and review on reconsideration of subpart F, the staff 
does not perceive the need for significant modification or revision of the rules.  The staff 
recommends continuing to monitor developments as the Wireless Bureau completes its 
implementation of ULS for all wireless services, which is expected to occur by the end of the 
year.


PART 1, SUBPART I - PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL 
POLICY ACT OF 1969
Description
Subpart I of the Commission's rules  implements the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  as well as a series of other federal environmental laws, such 
as the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended,  The National Historic Preservation Act of 
1966,  the Wilderness Act of 1964, as amended,  laws relating to Indian Ceremonial Sites  and 
the Wildlife Refuge Laws.   In addition, the Commission's environmental rules implement 
Executive Orders regarding flood plains and wetlands regulation.   By statute and/or as set forth 
in the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ),  the Commission is 
responsible for ensuring compliance with these laws.  The rules, finally, identify certain special 
issues for consideration, including the impact of high-intensity white lights on towers in 
residential neighborhoods  and the effect of radiofrequency emissions on the human 
environment. 
Purpose
The purpose of the Commission's environmental rules is to identify those sensitive environmental 
issues which Commission licensees must address.  As the primary Federal agency managing and 
licensing radio spectrum to broadcasters, wireless telephone carriers and other public and 
private radio users, the Commission complies with NEPA by requiring its licensees to assess 
and, if found, report the potential environmental consequences of their proposed projects.
If a federally-licensed facility, such as the construction of a tower by a licensee, might affect the 
environment in one of the ways described in the rules, the licensee, on behalf of the Commission, 
is required to consider the potential environmental effects from its project, to describe those 
potential effects in an environmental assessment (EA) and file that document with the 
Commission.   The Commission has concluded that actions not identified in its rules are 
categorically excluded from environmental review.   The Commission's environmental rules 
then explain what information is required in an EA,  the methods for the public to file objections 
to EAs,  and those situations in which a full environmental impact statement must be 
completed,  as required by NEPA.
Analysis
Advantages
The Commission's environmental rules meet the Commission's obligation as a federal agency to 
consider the affect on the environment, as required by a number of statutes, of proposed facilities 
constructed by its licensees.  The principal advantage of the Commission's environmental rules is 
that they streamline compliance with multiple environmental laws and focus environmental 
review activities to those that have a potential to significantly affect the environment.  The rules 
rely on licensees to perform preliminary analyses to determine if there will be an environmental 
effect by contacting expert state and federal agencies.  Only where there may be an environmental 
effect are licensees required to file environmental assessments with the Commission.  Thus, a 
substantial number of facilities are categorically excluded from processing by the Commission 
because licensees have determined the proposed facilities will not affect the environment.  In 
those cases where there may be an effect on the environment a detailed evaluation of the 
environmental effect is performed by the licensee, filed with the Commission, and approved prior 
to construction of the proposed facilities. 
Disadvantages
The environmental laws as implemented by the Commission can create administrative burdens 
and delays in the implementation of federally-licensed projects.  Moreover, the expert agencies 
contacted by licensees to determine if proposed projects will have an environmental effect are 
potentially overburdened with the number of requests from the Commission's licensees because 
of substantial facility construction.  Because the Commission's rules are streamlined and rely on 
licensees to make the initial evaluation of environmental effect of proposed facilities, licensees 
sometimes construct facilities that have an adverse effect on the environment without obtaining 
approval from the Commission.  In these cases, licensees generally construct without contacting 
expert agencies or adequately assessing the effect on the environment. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission staff is currently conducting negotiations with the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation designed to develop a programmatic agreement to streamline compliance with 
historic preservation laws.  Members of the staff have also attended various environmental 
seminars, workshops, and meetings to identify areas where the FCC has compliance obligations, 
to explain the Commission's rules, and to evaluate how the FCC's environmental obligations can 
be streamlined. 
Recommendation
In general, the staff recommends that the subpart I rules be retained because they are statutorily 
mandated and fulfill important public interest goals.  The staff also recommends, however, that 
the rules be evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether they meet the Commission's 
environmental obligations and can be streamlined in order to minimize administrative cost and 
delay. 



PART 1, SUBPART J - POLE ATTACHMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES
Description
Subpart J implements section 224 of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by Pub. Law No. 
95-234, as amended.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996  significantly amended section 224.  
Subpart J contains complaint and enforcement procedures to ensure that telecommunications 
carriers and cable system operators have nondiscriminatory access to a utility's poles, ducts, 
conduits and rights-of-way with rates, terms and conditions that are just and reasonable.  It is 
applicable in States that have not certified to the Commission that they regulate pole attachments. 
Purpose
The purpose of subpart J is to provide a simple and expeditious process for resolving complaints 
filed pursuant to section 224 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  Subpart J sets 
forth uniform definitions, procedures and requirements for an aggrieved party to seek redress for 
unjust and unreasonable rates, terms and conditions which act to impede deployment of facilities 
and equipment necessary to foster diverse communication capability throughout the nation. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
The relevant market for purposes of pole attachment regulation is the existing local pool of poles, 
ducts, conduits and rights-of-way to which cable or telecommunications service providers, out of 
necessity or business convenience, must attach their distribution facilities.  At the time of 
adoption of section 224, utilities enjoyed a superior bargaining position over attachers in 
negotiating the rates, terms and conditions for pole attachments due to the utilities' monopoly 
position in the ownership or control of these facilities.   That monopoly position has not changed 
since the passage of section 224, leaving open the possibility of anti-competitive practices by 
utilities against cable or competitive telecommunications providers in the absence of section 224.
Advantages
Subpart J provides a simple and expeditious complaint process and methodology to determine a 
maximum just and reasonable pole attachment rate a utility may charge an attaching 
telecommunications carrier or cable system operator.  When a dispute arises, subpart J provides a 
mechanism for preventing unfair pole attachment practices, thereby minimizing the effect of 
unjust and unreasonable pole attachment practices on the deployment of cable television and 
telecommunications services to the public.  Because subpart J provides a means for parties to 
predict an estimated rate a utility may charge by using an established set of formulas based on 
rebuttable presumptions and generally publicly available data that utilities report to their 
respective regulatory agencies, it promotes successful negotiation between parties and reduces the 
burden which might otherwise be associated with rate setting.
Disadvantages
Although cable system operators and telecommunications carriers must first attempt to negotiate 
rates, terms and conditions of attaching to a utility's poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, in 
the event that negotiations are not successful, subpart J imposes certain transaction costs on the 
parties in order to successfully pursue and respond to the complaint driven rules.  However, the 
process has been kept as simple and expeditious as possible to ensure that the burden on the 
parties is kept to a minimum.
Recent Efforts
In the Pole Fee Order  the Commission refined and clarified the formula used to calculate the 
maximum just and reasonable rate a utility may charge a cable service or telecommunications 
service provider for attachments to a pole, duct, conduit or right-of-way prior to February 8, 
2001, and continuing for cable operators not providing telecommunications services after 
February 8, 2001.  Petitions for reconsideration and/or clarification of this order are pending.  In 
the Telecommunications Carrier Report and Order,  the Commission adopted a separate 
methodology for attachments by telecommunications service providers, including cable systems 
providing telecommunications services, after February 8, 2001, as mandated by section 224.  
Petitions for reconsideration and/or clarification of this order are pending.  In the Local 
Competition Order,  the Commission enumerated guidelines concerning the reasonableness of 
certain terms and conditions of access.  These guidelines were later modified and refined in the 
Local Competition Reconsideration Order.   
Recommendation
Subpart J is necessary to implement and enforce section 224 of the Communications Act.  The 
complaint driven process encourages parties to negotiate and when applied, acts to prevent 
utilities from setting monopoly rates for infrastructure necessary to the competitive deployment of 
cable and telecommunications services.  The necessity for these rules is increased by the influx of 
utilities entering the telecommunications field.  In the last two years, the Commission has 
significantly revised and clarified subpart J in response to Congress' expansion and modification 
of section 224.  The staff concludes that significant modification or repeal of the subpart J rules is 
not necessary at this time.


PART 1, SUBPART Q - COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEEDINGS
Description
Subpart Q implements section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993  and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.   Subpart Q 
sets forth rules governing the mechanisms and procedures for competitive bidding to award 
spectrum licenses. 
Purpose
The purpose of subpart Q is to establish a uniform set of competitive bidding rules and procedures 
for use in licensing of all services that are subject to licensing by auction.  The rules in this 
subpart: (1) specify which services are eligible for competitive bidding; (2) provide competitive 
bidding mechanisms and design options; (3) establish application, disclosure and certification 
procedures for short- and long-form applications; (4) specify down payment, withdrawal and 
default mechanisms.  
In addition, subpart Q contains rules that define eligibility for "designated entity" (i.e., small 
business) status, and includes a schedule of bidding credits for which designated entities may 
qualify in those auctions in which special provisions are made for designated entities.   The 
purpose of these provisions is to implement section 309(j)(3)(B) of the Act, which states that an 
objective of designing and implementing the competitive bidding system is to "promot[e] 
economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are 
readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration on licenses and 
disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural 
telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women." 
Analysis
Advantages
The subpart Q competitive bidding rules establish procedures for the efficient licensing of 
spectrum.  Use of auction procedures allows for substantially faster licensing than alternative 
licensing methods such as comparative hearings, and is more likely to result in award of licenses 
to those entities that value the spectrum the most and will use it most efficiently.  Auction rules 
also enable the Commission to recover a portion of the value of the spectrum for the benefit of the 
public.  
Subpart Q is the result of the Commission's consolidation of its auction rules in the Part 1 
rulemaking proceeding (WT Docket No. 97-82).  Prior to the Part 1 proceeding, the Commission 
implemented service-specific auction rules for each new auctioned service.  Consolidating the 
auction rules in Part 1 has resulted in more consistency and predictability in the auctions process 
from service to service.
Disadvantages
The auction rules in this subpart impose certain transaction costs on auction participants (aside 
from the obligation on the winning bidder to pay the amount bid).  These include filing and 
reporting requirements, as well as the cost of maintaining staff and electronic resources to 
participate in auctions that may last several weeks or months.  These auction-related costs may be 
somewhat higher than the cost of filing a lottery application.  However, they also tend to 
discourage frivolous or speculative applications and are critical for ensuring the integrity of the 
auction process.  In addition, certain aspects of the auctions process (e.g., setting of minimum 
opening bid amounts, bid increments, and bidding credit levels) still require service-specific 
notice and comment prior to each individual auction.  Nonetheless, the delays associated with this 
process are significantly less than those historically associated with licensing by lottery or 
hearing.
Recent Efforts
The Commission has made significant changes to the competitive bidding rules of subpart Q in 
recent years.  The overall objectives of these competitive bidding rulemakings are: (1) 
consolidation of competitive bidding rules; and (2) the establishment of a uniform set of rules 
instead of a customized set of rules for each service.  In the Part 1 Third Report and Order,  the 
Commission made substantive amendments and modifications to the competitive bidding rules 
for all auctionable services.  These changes to the competitive bidding rules are intended to 
streamline regulations and eliminate unnecessary rules wherever possible, increase the 
efficiency of the competitive bidding process, and provide more specific guidance to auction 
participants.  The changes also advance the auction program by reducing the burden on the 
Commission and the public of conducting service-by-service auction rule makings.  
Recommendation
In general, the competitive bidding rules in this subpart are integral to the basic licensing and 
spectrum management functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for these rules is 
also not significantly affected by changes in the level of competition in the auctionable services.  
In addition, the Commission has significantly revised and streamlined the competitive bidding 
rules in this subpart in several proceedings.  Therefore, the staff concludes that significant 
modification or repeal of the subpart Q rules is not necessary at this time.


PART 1, SUBPART T - EXEMPT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES
Description
Sections 1.5000 through 1.5007  implement provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 
by which a public utility holding company may obtain a determination from the Commission of 
status as an Exempt Telecommunications Company (ETC).  By obtaining ETC status under these 
procedures, these firms become exempt from the "line of business" restrictions of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA).  Those restrictions, which are subject to regulation of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, would otherwise preclude these firms from entering 
markets that are not related to the provision of public utility service. 
Purpose
The purpose of these rules is thus to enable public utility holding companies to enter the 
telecommunications industry and thereby increase the number of possible entrants into this 
industry.  
Analysis
The rules achieve the purpose in a very effective, streamlined way.  Notably, under section 
1.5004, if the Commission does not issue an order denying an ETC application within 60 days of 
receipt of the application, the application is deemed granted as a matter of law.  Under section 
1.5003, a person applying in good faith for a Commission determination of ETC status is deemed 
to be an ETC from the date of receipt of the application until the date of Commission action 
pursuant to section 1.5004.  To implement these provisions, the Commission invites comments on 
each application under section 1.5007 and at the same time notifies the Securities and Exchange 
Commission under section 1.5005 that the Applicant is deemed to be an exempt 
telecommunications company.  If the Commission receives comments warranting denial, it issues 
an order within 60 days of receipt of the application denying the application and notifies the SEC, 
but otherwise the Commission takes no further action to grant these applications.
Recommendation
Staff recommends that these rules be retained.


PART 2, SUBPART B - ALLOCATION, ASSIGNMENT, AND USE OF RADIO FREQUENCIES
Description
Section 303(c) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the Commission authority 
to "assign bands of frequencies to the various classes of stations." Part 2, subpart B implements 
this authority and contains the Table of Allocations which identifies the services allowed for 
various frequency bands.  The Table of Allocations is strongly influenced by the International 
Telecommunications Union's (ITU) Radio Regulations which contain an international allocation 
table and have the legal status of a treaty.  The international allocations are noted for information 
purposes in the Table of Allocations.
Purpose 
The Table of Allocations acts as a basic framework for the various service rules for each radio 
service.  It also is the basic mechanism for coordinating with the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration under section 305 of the Act to regulate stations operated by the 
federal government.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not applicable: Part 2 subpart B does not regulate market entry or pricing.
Advantages
The Table of Allocations clearly sets out what radio services are permitted in each band and the 
primary or secondary status of each.  As such users clearly can see what other classes of stations 
may enter their band or adjacent bands and what priority they have with respect to those uses.
Disadvantages 
For some new radio technologies, a two-step process is needed to implement their use:  first 
implementation of an allocation table change, and then adoption of service rules.  We have 
addressed this problem at times in the past by combining the two steps in cases where speed was 
important and the issues were clear.  Some types of new services also require changes in the 
ITU's Radio Regulations, but this step is a treaty requirement beyond FCC's control.
Recent Efforts
The allocation table is dynamic and is amended several times yearly to address new services and 
changes to existing services.
Recommendation
 The staff recommends retaining the table in its current form and continuing the present procedure 
of incremental change as the need arises.


PART 3 - AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTING AUTHORITIES IN 
MARITIME AND MARITIME MOBILE-SATELLITE RADIO SERVICES.
Description
This rule part implements 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j) and 303(r).  Part 3 sets forth rules for 
authorizing, controlling and monitoring the issuance of accounting authority identification codes 
(AAIC).  The rule places specific reporting requirements on authorized Accounting Authorities 
and addresses the Commission's enforcement policy.  It also establishes rules, which monitor the 
business conduct of authorized Accounting Authorities.  
At any given time, there are no more than 25 authorized accounting authorities with a minimum 
of 15 "US" AAICs reserved for use by the accounting authorities conducting settlement 
operations with the United States.  
Accounting Authorities are responsible for settling accounts for pubic correspondence due to 
foreign administrations for messages transmitted at sea by or between maritime mobile stations 
located on board ships subject to U.S. registry and utilizing foreign coast and coast earth station 
facilities.  
Purpose
These rules are intended to ensure that settlements of accounts for U.S. licensed ship radio 
stations are conducted in accordance with the International Telecommunications Regulations, 
taking into account the applicable ITU-T recommendations.
Analysis
Advantages
? Establishes and formalizes procedures for controlling the issuance of accounting 
authority identification codes.
? Establishes rules and guidance for administering accounting authority activities.
? Addresses ITU-T Recommendations
? Compliance with International Telecommunications Regulations.
? Implements specific reporting requirements
? Provides the opportunity for the Commission to privatize its own internal accounting 
authority activities.

Disadvantages
Administrative burden of monitoring the activities of private accounting authorities. 
Recent Efforts
The International Bureau (IB) is currently drafting a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
(FNPRM) which, among other things, considers privatizing the role currently performed by 
USO1.  USO1 is the Commission's internal accounting authority.  OMD's International 
Telecommunications Settlements Group administers the settlement activities for USO1.  The 
group is located in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  For years USO1 has handled all communications 
traffic, not otherwise contracted with one of the interim accounting authorities.  With the 
implementation of Part 3 and the adoption of rules proposed in the pending FNPRM, the 
Commission plans to get out of the business of settling maritime accounts.  Focus would then be 
placed on administering and monitoring the activities of authorized accounting authorities. 
Recommendation
Recommend the entire rule part stand as written, pending IB completion of its current rule 
making to privatize the Commission's internal accounting authority (USO1).


PART 15 RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES
Description
Section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the Commission authority to 
regulate devices which may interfere with radio reception and requires the Commission to adopt 
regulations forbidding the sale of equipment capable in intercepting domestic cellular radio 
telecommunications service.
Purpose
The purpose of Part 15 is to provide technical guidance regarding radio devices, including 
prevention of interference, prohitions on cellular transmission and reception interception, and 
requirements for television receivers and V chips. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
The markets affected by Part 15 are competitive.
Advantages
The requirements of Part 15 are clear and competitively neutral.
Disadvantages
The requirements impose some regulatory costs on equipment in both having to be designed to 
comply and having to show compliance.  The required approvals slow market entry slightly.
Recent Efforts
The Part 15 rules are continually revised to address evolving technology.
Recommendation
The staff recommends several specific changes to Part 15:
? Incorporate the new ANSI C63.4 test procedure for unlicensed PCS systems to 
remove certain present ambiguities
? Amend rules to establish conditions under which intentional transmitter modules can 
be authorized and then incorporated into larger units without addition equipment 
authorization.
? Review emission standards above 2 GHz to adjust in view of changes in licensed 
services at these frequencies.
? Amend 15.231 to permit data transmission by intermittent unlicensed transmitters 
permitted by this rule.


PART 17 - CONSTRUCTION, MARKING, AND LIGHTING OF ANTENNA STRUCTURES
Description
Part 17  sets forth the procedures by which the Commission registers and assigns painting and 
lighting requirements to those antenna structures that may pose a physical hazard to aircraft.  
These procedures implement section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.   
The rules require registration, evaluation and approval by the Commission, in conjunction with 
the recommendations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), of any proposed 
construction or modification of an antenna structure that is a potential hazard to aircraft.  The 
rules also require tower owners to paint and light their antenna structures as necessary to protect 
air navigation. 
The Antenna Structure Registration procedures set forth in Part 17 are distinct from the FCC's 
licensing functions.  The registration of an antenna structure that affects air navigation is a pre-
condition to FCC licensing of radio facilities at a particular site.
Purpose
The purpose of Part 17 is to insure that tower owners do not construct structures that may pose a 
hazard to air navigation (and FCC licensees do not site facilities on such structures) unless and 
until the antenna structures comply with federal aviation safety requirements. 
Analysis
Advantages
The Part 17 rules implement section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and 
provide critical safety-of-life functions by insuring that antenna structures hosting FCC licensees 
are sufficiently conspicuous to aircraft.  The rules are limited to those classes of antenna 
structures that may reasonably be expected to pose an air safety hazard (generally, antenna 
structures that are taller than 200 feet or that are in close proximity to airports) and, therefore, that 
must be individually examined in conjunction with the FAA.  Antenna structure owners are 
responsible for compliance with the rules, which allows for a single point of contact for a 
particular antenna structure and which eliminate the need for each party on a multi-tenant 
structure to undertake the registration process.
Disadvantages
The Part 17 rules impose an additional regulatory cost on antenna structure owners.  Because 
proposed facilities that meet the registration criteria must be studied by the FAA and registered 
by the Commission prior to construction, an owner who is unable to allocate sufficient time for 
this process risks delaying a licensee's ability to obtain an authorization for, and to begin service 
from, individual antenna structures.
Recent Efforts
The Commission's antenna structure registration program was substantially revised in 1995.   In 
a March 2000 Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, the Commission reaffirmed 
the antenna structure registration procedures adopted in 1995, but clarified several rules.   In 
addition, the Commission has updated individual radio service rules during the course of 
rulemaking proceedings in order to cross-reference the Part 17 Rules.  
Recommendation
In general, the rules in this part are critical to the safety-of-life duties required by the section 
303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  In addition, the Commission recently 
reaffirmed the antenna structure clearance process.  Accordingly, the staff concludes that it is 
unnecessary to significantly restructure or repeal the Part 17 rules at this time.  However, the staff 
has identified some rules that it believes could be modified or eliminated without compromising 
the public safety goals embodied in this rule part.  These rules are either duplicative or 
inconsistent with the procedures antenna structure owners must undertake when notifying the 
FAA,  create unnecessary administrative burdens on antenna structure owners,  or are apt to 
confuse owners and licensees who attempt to comply with our Part 17 rules. 


PART 20 - COMMERCIAL MOBILE RADIO SERVICES, SECTION 20.6 ? CMRS SPECTRUM 
AGGREGATION LIMIT
Description
Section 20.6  limits the amount of broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum that any entity 
can hold in a common geographic area.  The rule further defines the types of ownership and other 
interests that are attributable under the cap.  The cap was adopted in 1994,  and modified in 1999 
(see discussion below).  
Purpose
The purpose of section 20.6 is to promote competition in the broadband CMRS market by 
preventing any wireless carrier from gaining undue market power or restricting entry through the 
accumulation of CMRS spectrum.
Analysis
Advantages
The spectrum cap minimizes potential for anti-competitive behavior by avoiding excessive 
concentration of licenses, and ensures that licenses are distributed among a wide variety of 
applicants.  By applying a bright-line test to spectrum aggregation, the rule also reduces 
transaction costs associated with case-by-case review of such transactions.  
Disadvantages
By restricting aggregation of spectrum, the spectrum cap may limit economies of scale or scope 
that could otherwise be achieved by carriers subject to the cap.  The rule also potentially limits 
carriers' ability to provide new services to the extent such services require more spectrum 
resources than the cap allows.  
Recent Efforts
On September 15, 1999, the Commission adopted a Report and Order that retained the spectrum 
cap, with some modifications.   The Commission maintained the original 45 MHz cap for most 
areas, but increased the cap to 55 MHz for rural areas.  In addition, the Commission adopted a 
separate benchmark for the spectrum cap of 40 percent equity ownership by passive institutional 
investors.  The Commission also established a waiver mechanism for carriers who can 
demonstrate that strict application of the cap will impair their ability to provide 3G or other 
innovative services.  The Commission stated in the Report and Order that while it was retaining 
the cap, it would further consider in the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review whether the cap should 
be retained, repealed, or modified. 
Several carriers filed petitions for waiver or forbearance with respect to application of the 
spectrum cap to the upcoming C and F Block auction scheduled for November 2000.  On August 
29, 2000, the Commission issued the Sixth Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration in 
WT Docket No. 97-82, which held that the spectrum cap would apply to the C and F Block 
auction.  
Recommendation
As noted above, the Commission has stated that the spectrum cap will be reviewed as part of the 
2000 Biennial Regulatory Review.  The staff plans to prepare a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
for Commission consideration later this year.  


PART 20, SECTION 20.11 ? INTERCONNECTION TO FACILITIES OF LOCAL EXCHANGE 
CARRIERS
Description
Section 20.11  provides that local exchange carriers (LECs) must provide reasonable 
interconnection to commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers on request, and that LECs 
and CMRS providers must each reasonably compensate the other for terminating traffic that 
originates on their respective facilities.  This rule codifies section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Act,  which 
was enacted by Congress as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.   Section 
20.11 was adopted in 1994 in the CMRS Second Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93-252.  
In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress added sections 251 and 252 to the 
Communications Act.  These statutory provisions establish interconnection rights among all 
telecommunications carriers, and set forth terms and conditions under which interconnection must 
be provided by one carrier to another.   While enacting sections 251 and 252, Congress also left 
section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Act intact.  In the 1996 First Local Competition Order, the 
Commission codified new interconnection rules in Part 51 as part of its implementation of 
sections 251 and 252.    The Commission also concluded that in light of Congress' retention of 
section 332(c)(1)(B), the Commission retained separate authority over LEC-CMRS 
interconnection pursuant to that section.    Because the Commission viewed sections 251, 252, 
and 332 of the Act as furthering a common goal with respect to interconnection, the Commission 
declined at that point to further act on or define the scope of its section 332 interconnection 
authority, but instead amended section 20.11 to require that LECs and CMRS providers comply 
with the interconnection rules in Part 51.   
Section 20.11 is organized into three lettered sub-parts:  Subsection (a) requires LECs to provide 
the type of interconnection requested by mobile radio service providers, within reason.  
Subsection (b) requires LECs and CMRS providers to reasonably compensate each other for 
terminating traffic that originates on each other's facilities.  Subsection (c) requires LECs and 
CMRS providers to comply with the Part 51 interconnection rules.
Purpose
The purpose of the LEC-CMRS interconnection rule is to promote competition in the 
telecommunications market by ensuring that all LECs and CMRS providers provide reasonable 
interconnection to one another subject to reasonable rates, terms, and conditions.  The rule is 
particularly directed to regulating the conduct of LECs with market power in their 
interconnection relationships with CMRS providers.  Historically, some LECs denied or restricted 
interconnection options available to CMRS providers, or required CMRS providers to 
compensate the LEC for LEC-originated traffic that terminated on the CMRS provider's network.  
Congress enacted section 332(c)(1)(B), and the Commission adopted section 20.11 codifying this 
provision, in order to curtail such practices. 
Analysis
Advantages
Section 20.11 sets forth basic requirements for reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection 
arrangements between LECs and CMRS providers, but does not impose detailed standards or 
technical requirements.  Thus, it reduces the potential for anti-competitive behavior, while 
affording carriers reasonable flexibility with respect to the terms and conditions of 
interconnection so long as the basic requirements of the rule are adhered to.
Disadvantages
Section 20.11 imposes certain transaction costs on carriers to ensure that their interconnection 
arrangements comply with the rule, and may lead to disputes and litigation between carriers about 
what constitutes "reasonable" interconnection under the rule.  In addition, the overlap between 
this rule and the Part 51 interconnection rules may cause some duplication of regulatory 
requirements.  
Recent Efforts
Since the addition of subsection (c) in 1996, section 20.11 has not been revised.  In February 
2000, Sprint PCS filed an analysis of CMRS traffic-sensitive costs of terminating local calls 
originating on LECs' networks, and requested the Commission to consider rules that would 
mandate recovery of such costs.    The Commission has sought comment on Sprint's filing.   
The issue is still pending review.
Although section 20.11 has not been judicially challenged, the related Part 51 rules continue to be 
the subject of litigation.  On July 18, 2000, on remand form the Supreme Court, the Eighth 
Circuit vacated portions of the FCC's forward-looking pricing methodology, proxy prices, and 
wholesale pricing provisions.   To the extent that section 20.11 requires compliance with Part 51, 
this litigation affects carriers' obligations under both sets of rules.  
Recommendation
The staff recommends retaining section 20.11.  Although there is some overlap with the 
interconnection requirements of Part 51, retention of the rule is appropriate in light of the fact that 
Congress has retained the separate statutory provision in section 332 governing LEC-CMRS 
interconnection. 


PART 20, SECTION 20.12 ? RESALE AND ROAMING
[Note: Section 20.12 addresses two distinct issues: resale and roaming.  This analysis deals with 
each separately.]  
RESALE
Description
Section 20.12(b)  provides that any carrier of Broadband PCS, Cellular Radio Telephone 
Service, or Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) Services that offers real-time, two-way 
interconnected voice service with switching capability ("covered CMRS provider") must permit 
unrestricted resale of its services.  The resale rule was adopted in 1996 in the First Report and 
Order in CC Docket No. 94-54. 
Section 20.12(b) further provides that the resale provision will cease to be effective five years 
after the date of the award of the last group of initial licenses for broadband PCS.  The 
Commission has since determined the last PCS award date for purposes of this rules was 
November 25, 1997.  Therefore, the resale rule is set to expire on November 24, 2002.   
However, resale arrangements will continue to be subject to the non-discrimination and 
reasonableness requirements of sections 201 and 202 of the Communications Act  after that date.
Purpose
The purpose of the resale rule is to promote competition in the wireless telephony market by 
preventing facilities-based covered CMRS carriers from restricting resale of their services.  The 
rule is particularly directed to promoting competition during the period that broadband PCS 
providers are building out their facilities-based networks to compete with incumbent cellular 
carriers.  The Commission has concluded that by November 2002, PCS buildout should be 
sufficient to obviate the need for the rule.   
Analysis
Status of Competition
As described in the Fifth Competition Report, the broadband PCS sector has engaged in 
significant buildout in recent years.   However, broadband PCS has not yet achieved full parity 
with cellular as a facilities-based competitor.  The Fifth Competition Report also notes that PCS 
providers have yet to achieve the same level of geographic coverage or subscribership as cellular, 
particularly in smaller markets.   
Advantages
The resale rule provides a "bright-line" test that minimizes potential for anti-competitive 
behavior.  By prohibiting CMRS carriers from any restrictions on resale, the rule ensures no 
carrier may offer like communications services to a reseller at less favorable prices, or on less 
favorable terms or conditions, than are available to similarly situated customers. 
Disadvantages
The resale rule imposes administrative costs on facilities-based carriers associated with 
negotiating and entering into resale agreements, resolving disputes with resellers, and litigation of 
compliance issues.  The rule also may impose technical costs associated with accommodating 
resellers on facilities-based networks and billing of resale service.  
Recent Efforts
In response to petitions for reconsideration of the CMRS Resale Order, the Commission recently 
conducted a comprehensive review of the resale rule.  In the CMRS Resale Reconsideration 
Order, adopted on September 15, 1999, the Commission rejected arguments that the rule should 
be repealed immediately, and determined that retaining the rule (with minor modifications) until 
the November 2002 sunset date would best promote competition and balance the costs and 
benefits of the rule.   
Recommendation
In light of the Commission's recent comprehensive review of the resale rule, discussed above, the 
staff finds no need to make further recommendations at this time.  The staff recommends that the 
Commission continue to evaluate the resale rule in light of competitive conditions in the CMRS 
market sector.
ROAMING
Description
Roaming occurs when the subscriber of one CMRS provider utilizes the facilities of another 
CMRS provider with which the subscriber has no direct pre-existing service or financial 
relationship to place an outgoing call, to receive an incoming call, or to continue an in-progress 
call.  Roaming can be done "manually," in which a subscriber establishes a relationship with the 
host carrier usually by providing a credit card number, or "automatically," in which the subscriber 
does nothing more than turning on her telephone.  Automatic roaming requires a contractual 
agreement between the respective carriers.
Section 20.12(c)  provides that any "covered CMRS" carrier must provide mobile radio service 
upon request to any subscriber in good standing, including roamers, while the subscriber is within 
any portion of the licensee's licensed service area, and assuming that the subscriber is using 
technically compatible mobile equipment.  The rule only mandates that carriers offer manual 
roaming, and does not require provision of automatic roaming.  The rule was adopted in 1996.  
Purpose
The purpose of the roaming provision is to ensure seamless service to wireless customers who 
roam out of their home service areas, and to prevent carriers from restricting competition and 
consumer choice through refusal to provide service to roamers. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Most cellular carriers have reached automatic roaming agreements among themselves, even 
though section 20.12 only mandates manual roaming.  Carriers such as AT&T, Nextel, and 
Verizon have also developed nationwide "footprints" and wide-area calling plans that give their 
customers the ability to receive service outside their local area without paying roaming charges.  
However, some local and regional carriers have alleged that they have been unable to enter into 
roaming agreements with competing carriers.  Consumers' ability to roam may also be limited 
because they can only roam on networks that use the same technical standard (CDMA, TDMA, 
GSM, Iden) as the home carrier.  
Advantages
The roaming rule provides a clear baseline standard for carriers to follow with respect to the 
provision of roaming.  It is also minimally intrusive because it does not require CMRS carriers to 
reconfigure their systems to support technically incompatible roaming.  
Disadvantages
Manual roaming obligations impose some administrative and technical burdens associated with 
caller verification, billing, and similar issues.  
Recent Efforts
At the time that it adopted the manual roaming rule, the Commission also issued a Third Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket 94-54 on (1) whether to sunset the manual roaming rule, and 
(2) whether to mandate automatic roaming for any carriers.   On August 28, 2000, the 
Commission released a Third Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order on 
Reconsideration, in which it affirmed the existing manual roaming rule, with some modification 
and clarification.   The Commission also concluded that in light of technological advances and 
the rapid expansion of the CMRS market since the 1996 Roaming order, a new rulemaking 
proceeding should be initiated to address the impact of these developments on issues relating to 
both automatic and manual roaming.  The Commission stated that it would initiate such a 
proceeding in the near future.
Recommendation
The staff recommends that issues relating to whether to retain, eliminate, or sunset the roaming 
rule be addressed in the upcoming rulemaking proceeding. 


PART 20, SECTION 20.18 - 911 SERVICE
Description
Section 20.18  requires certain broadband CMRS providers (delineated in subpart (a) of this rule) 
to comply with guidelines set by the Commission for the implementation of Enhanced 911 
services (E911) for all of their customers, including those customers requiring TTY devices. 
Section 20.18 was adopted in 1996 in CC Docket No. 94-102.  The rule provides for 
implementation of E911 in two phases.  In Phase I, CMRS carriers must implement E911 
capability in their networks that will provide 911 dispatchers with a callback number as well as 
the location of the cell site that received the call, which will enable the dispatcher to estimate the 
caller's whereabouts.  In Phase II, carriers must provide Automatic Location Identification (ALI) 
capability for all 911 calls placed by wireless telephone users, so that the caller's location can be 
determined with greater accuracy.  
The rule provides for implementation of Phase I by April 1, 1998.  In Phase II, licensees who 
employ network-based solutions must provide service to at least 50 percent of their coverage area 
or their population by October 1, 2001, and licensees employing handset-based technologies must 
ensure that at least 50 percent of all new handsets activated are location-capable by October 1, 
2001.   Section 20.18 further describes who must comply with E911 requirements, the basic 
E911 service that CMRS carriers must provide, as well as the accuracy percentage and timeframe 
in which these services must be deployed.  Finally, the rule provides alternative requirements for 
carriers who choose to employ an intermediary dispatcher rather than routing their customers' 
911 calls directly to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
Purpose
The purpose of section 20.18 is to enhance public safety and facilitate effective and efficient law 
enforcement.  Without E911 services, a dispatcher receiving a wireless 911 call can only obtain 
information regarding the caller's location and callback number if the caller is able to provide it.  
This contrasts to certain advanced features that are available to wireline 911 customers.  By 
mandating that public safety service providers have the ability to locate wireless callers instantly 
and accurately, section 20.18 rule attempts to provide the same reliable and ubiquitous aid to 
wireless 911 callers that is available to wireline callers. 
Analysis
Advantages
The E911 rule sets national standards and deadlines to ensure that all CMRS carriers throughout 
the U.S. will provide E911 services in a timely manner.  This encourages equipment 
manufacturers and CMRS carriers to take public safety into consideration in the design and 
production of equipment and the provision of service.  At the same time, the rule is 
technologically and competitively neutral, which allows carriers and equipment manufacturers to 
make their own decisions as to the best method for implementing E911 capability.  Allowing 
manufacturers and carriers to adopt the technology of their choice also lowers costs and fosters 
technological innovation, because it encourages the parties to arrive at a solution that is both 
effective and cost-efficient.  Finally, because section 20.18 clearly delineates CMRS provider's 
obligations as to E911 services and ALI compatibility, the FCC can easily determine which 
carriers have failed to comply with the mandate and are not providing sufficient E911 services.  
Disadvantages
The E911 rule imposes administrative, technical, and economic costs on carriers who must 
reconfigure their networks to comply with the rule.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission has been considering waiver requests from CMRS providers to extend the 
deadlines for implementation in order to reflect and recognize new technologies whose 
implementations cannot be completed in the allotted timeframe.  On September 8, 2000, the 
Commission issued a Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order in the E911 proceeding, in which 
it  (1) extended from October 1, 2000 to November 9, 2000, the date for carriers to file E911 
Phase II implementation reports; (2) extended the deadline for carriers to begin selling and 
activating ALI-capable handsets from March 1, 2001 to October 1, 2001;  (3) adopted a revised 
phase-in schedule for deployment of ALI-capable handsets;  and (4) extended from December 31, 
2004, to December 31, 2005, the date for carriers to reach full penetration of ALI-capable 
handsets in their total subscriber bases.   The Commission also granted a limited waiver of the 
accuracy standards toVoiceStream Wireless to permit it to deploy a "hybrid" location solution, 
subject to a timetable that will require it to deploy ALI-capable handsets faster than the timetable 
originally set forth in the Third Report and Order, and substantially faster than the revised 
timetable adopted in the current Order.
Recommendation
Due to the crucial role that the E911 rule plays in upholding and enhancing public safety, the staff 
recommends that this rule be retained.  While E911 requirements impose a burden on CMRS 
providers, the necessity of providing sufficient E911 services for callers in need outweighs this 
burden.  The staff recommends that Commission continue to review the rule as implementation of 
E911 progresses.  


PART 20, SECTION 20.20 ? CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO PROVISION OF CMRS SERVICE 
BY LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS
Description
Section 20.20  requires incumbent LECs (ILECs) providing in-region broadband CMRS to 
provide such services through a separate affiliate.  The rule further imposes restrictions on the 
separate affiliate, including: (1) maintaining separate books of account; (2) not jointly owning 
transmission or switching facilities with the affiliated ILEC that the ILEC uses for the provision 
of local exchange services in the same market; and (3) acquiring any services from the affiliated 
ILEC on a compensatory arm's length basis pursuant to our affiliate transaction rules.  
Additionally, Title II common carrier services, or services, facilities or network elements 
provided pursuant to sections 251 and 252, that are acquired from the affiliated ILEC must be 
available to all other carriers, including CMRS providers, on the same terms and conditions.  
Furthermore, all transactions between the ILEC and the cellular affiliate must be reduced to 
writing, and a copy of all such agreements (other than interconnection agreements) must be 
available for inspection upon reasonable request by the Commission.
Rural ILECs are exempt from the separate affiliate requirement.  A competing CMRS carrier 
interconnected with the rural telephone carrier may petition the Commission to remove the 
exemption where the rural telephone company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct.  Small-
and mid-sized ILECs serving fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines are entitled 
to petition the Commission for suspension or modification of the separate affiliate requirement.
Section 20.20 was adopted in 1997 in WT Docket No. 96-162.   The rule became effective on 
February 11, 1998.  Section 20.20(f)  provides that the rule will sunset on January 1, 2002.
Purpose
The purpose of the ILEC/CMRS separate affiliate requirement is to prevent ILECs from using 
their market power in the local exchange market to engage in anti-competitive practices in the 
CMRS market.  
Analysis
Advantages
The separate affiliate rule promotes competition by requiring transparency and arm's length 
transactions between ILECs and their CMRS affiliates, and by ensuring that ILECs cannot offer 
their CMRS affiliates more favorable terms and conditions than they offer to unaffiliated 
competing CMRS providers.  The rule also provides greater flexibility for rural, small, and mid-
sized ILECs, where there is less risk of the ILEC having sufficient market power to restrain 
CMRS competition. 
Disadvantages
By requiring use of a separate affiliate for CMRS operations, separate ownership of certain 
facilities, and written, arms-length transactions between ILECs and their CMRS affiliates, section 
20.20 increases transaction costs for carriers subject to the rule.
Recent Efforts
The Commission has recently denied petitions for reconsideration of the separate affiliate 
requirements in section 20.20.   
Recommendation
In light of the Commission's recent orders on reconsideration of the separate affiliate rule, and the 
fact that the rule is scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2002, the staff does not recommend any 
changes to section 20.20 at this time.  The staff will continue to evaluate whether the competitive 
conditions in the local exchange market merit continued application of the rule.  


PART 21-DOMESTIC PUBLIC FIXED RADIO SERVICES
Description
Statutory authority for Part 21 of the Commission's rules is found in Titles I through III of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  The purpose of the rules and regulations in Part 21 is 
to prescribe the manner in which portions of the radio spectrum may be made available for 
domestic communication common carrier and multipoint distribution service non-common carrier 
operations which require transmitting facilities on land or in specified offshore coastal areas 
within the continental shelf. 
Part 21 is organized into seven lettered sub-parts (excluding reserved subparts):

A - General
B - Applications and Licenses
C - Technical Standards
D - Technical Operation
E - Miscellaneous
F - Developmental Authorizations
G-J - [Reserved]
K - Multipoint Distribution Service

Purpose
Part 21 is intended to ensure that licensees are financially and technically qualified to provide 
service in a manner that will not create interference with authorized transmissions.  The 
procedures prescribed in Part 21 are designed to provide the Commission and the public with 
adequate information regarding licensees, prospective licensees, facilities, and proposed changes 
in facilities or in the ownership or control of licensees.  Finally, the rules are intended to promote 
efficient use of the radio spectrum and to encourage innovation in communication services, 
equipment, and techniques.
Analysis
Status of Competition 
Part 21 licensees provide video programming in competition with cable television systems, 
broadcast television stations, direct broadcast satellite systems, and other multichannel video 
programming distributors.  See Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in Markets for the 
Delivery of Video Programming, 15 FCC Rcd 978 (2000).  In addition, as a result of the 
Commission's decisions in its Two-Way Rulemaking,  Part 21 licensees now may offer two-way 
broadband transmission services in competition with numerous wireline and wireless service 
providers.  See Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability, 
14 FCC Rcd 2398, 2422-31 (1999).
Advantages
Part 21 licenses are awarded through a competitive bidding process, which creates an incentive 
for rapid deployment of services and, thus, promotes efficient use of the radio spectrum.  The 
technical standards in Part 21 ensure interference protection and promote effective use of 
proposed and authorized facilities.  The Part 21 rules further benefit the public by affording 
access to information regarding licensees, prospective licensees, facilities, and proposed changes 
in facilities or in the ownership or control of licensees.  Such access also reduces the cost of 
enforcing Commission rules by facilitating analysis by interested parties, thereby supplementing 
Commission review and enforcement efforts.  Finally, Part 21 promotes innovation through the 
availability of developmental authorizations for technical experimentation.
Disadvantages
Part 21 contains language and requirements that have been superseded by recent Commission 
rulemakings.
Recent Efforts
The Commission's decisions in its Two-Way Rulemaking, cited supra, allow Part 21 licensees to 
use their assigned frequencies to provide two-way communication services and to alternate 
between providing service on a common carrier or non-common carrier basis.  Recent changes in 
the Part 21 attribution rules encourage investment in Part 21 services by relaxing ownership 
restrictions.  Attribution of Broadcast and Cable/MDS Interests, 14 FCC Rcd 12559 (1999).
Recommendation 
The Staff recommends that Part 21 be reviewed to ensure consistency with recent Commission 
rulemakings.

PART 22 - PUBLIC MOBILE SERVICES
Description
Part 22  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for five commercial mobile radio 
(CMRS) services historically described as "Domestic Public Land Mobile Radio Services" or 
"DPLMRS." These services are the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service, the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the Air-Ground Radiotelephone 
Service, and the Offshore Radiotelephone Service.  Although these services differ in matters such 
as the allocated frequency bands, historical licensing methods, and technologies used, the 
common purpose of all of them is to make it possible for competing carriers to offer wireless 
mobile and/or fixed telecommunications services (especially paging and telephone service) to the 
public on a commercial basis.  In general, the rules in this part:  (1) specify the frequency bands 
allocated to each service; (2) provide methods for determining the protected service area of 
stations in each service; (3) establish minimum construction or coverage requirements for 
licensees; and (4) define technical limits on operation (e.g., transmitter power) to reduce the 
likelihood of interference.
Part 22 comprises 10 subparts: 

Subpart A  - Scope and Authority
Subpart B  - Licensing Requirements and Procedures
Subpart C  - Operational and Technical Requirements
Subpart D  - Developmental Authorizations
Subpart E  - Paging and Radiotelephone Service
Subpart F  - Rural Radiotelephone Service
Subpart G  - Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service
Subpart H  - Cellular Radiotelephone Service
Subpart I  - Offshore Radiotelephone Service
Subpart J  - Required New Capabilities Pursuant to the Communications Assistance for 
Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)

Subparts A, B, and C apply generally to all Part 22 licensees.  Subpart D provides for the 
licensing on a developmental basis of stations that are to be used for testing new technologies or 
services.  Each of the next five subparts (subparts E through I) contains rules applicable to one of 
the five specific Part 22 services.  Finally, subpart J implements the provisions of the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) as they apply to Part 22 
services.
Purpose
Part 22 of the Commission's rules comprises a minimal regulatory framework that facilitates the 
rapid, efficient provision of commercial wireless telecommunications services to the general 
public at reasonable rates, by:  (1) utilizing a competitive bidding process to issue exclusive 
licenses to the service provider applicants who value them most; (2) preserving and enhancing 
competition between these service providers once licensed; (3) ensuring that available spectrum 
allocations are used efficiently; and (4) reducing the likelihood of harmful interference between 
licensed stations.
Analysis
Status of Competition
As detailed in the Fifth Competition Report, CMRS providers, including those licensed under Part 
22, operate in an environment that is marked by significant and increasing competition in mobile 
telephony, paging/messaging, and mobile data.   The only Part 22 radio service that is not 
experiencing an increase in competition at this time is the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service, 
where there are currently only two remaining licensees, GTE Airphone and ATT Claircom, of the 
six that were originally licensed.  
Advantages
Overall, the Part 22 rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of 
spectrum.  In Part 22, provision for accepting competing mutually exclusive applications and 
selecting the licensee by means of competitive bidding results in licenses being issued to the 
entities that value them the most.  Geographic area licensing minimizes the amount of paperwork 
involved in obtaining a license and thus speeds the authorization of new competitive services to 
the public.  Minimal and flexible technical standards facilitate the introduction of new 
technologies.
Disadvantages
The Part 22 rules impose administrative burdens inherent to the licensing process and to 
compliance with technical and operational rules.  In addition, the flexible technical standards in 
most Part 22 services place the burden of coordination to avoid and resolve harmful interference 
between systems largely on the licensees themselves, which may increase transaction costs.  
Finally, while certain portions of the Part 22 rules have been recently revamped, other portions, 
most notably the cellular rules in subpart H, are now more than a decade old, and therefore may 
not appropriately reflect significant technological and competitive changes that have occurred in 
wireless services in recent years.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission has made significant changes to its Part 22 rules in recent years.  For example, 
in the Universal Licensing proceeding, the Commission eliminated many of the service-specific 
licensing rules in Part 22 as part of its consolidation of all wireless licensing rules into Part 1.   
The Commission also recently completed a comprehensive overhaul of its paging rules, in which 
it finalized the rules for the transition from site-by-site to geographic licensing and award of 
geographic paging licenses by auction. 
Recommendation
Many of the rules in Part 22 are integral to the basic spectrum management functions of the 
Commission.  The necessity for these rules is not significantly affected by changes in the level of 
competition in wireless services.  Moreover, as noted above, the Commission has significantly 
revised and streamlined portions of the Part 22 rules in recent proceedings.  However, Part 22 
also contains a number of relatively old rules, particularly rules applicable to cellular service, that 
were adopted when wireless technology and competitive conditions were very different from the 
present day.  For example, section 22.937,  which requires demonstration of a cellular 
applicant's financial qualifications, was adopted in connection with the use of lotteries to award 
licenses, which has been superseded by the use of competitive bidding.  Similarly, section 
22.323  allows Part 22 licensees to provide "incidental" fixed services, but prohibits cross-
subsidization of such services by subscribers to CMRS services - a rule that appears 
anachronistic given that CMRS rates are fully deregulated.  Therefore, the staff recommends that 
as part of the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review, the Commission should undertake a 
comprehensive review of the Part 22 cellular rules as well as other portions of Part 22 that have 
not received recent scrutiny. 

PART 22, SUBPART E - PAGING AND RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE
Description
Part 22, subpart E  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service ("PARS"), which is the original public mobile telephone service that was 
established in the 1960s.  This service was originally titled the "Domestic Public Land Mobile 
Radio Service" or "DPLMRS."  Frequency bands in the low VHF (35-43 MHz), high VHF (72-
76 MHz, 152-157 MHz), and UHF (454-459 MHz, 470-512 MHz and 931 MHz) ranges of the 
spectrum are allocated to this service.  Although originally used by local telephone companies 
and other carriers to provide the original analog mobile telephone service ("Improved Mobile 
Telephone Service" or "IMTS"), these allocations today are primarily used for tone, voice, 
numeric and alphanumeric paging services.  In general, the rules in this subpart:  (1) specify the 
frequency bands allocated to PARS; (2) provide methods for determining the reliable service area 
and interfering contour of individual stations; (3) establish construction and commencement of 
operation requirements for licensees; and (4) define technical limits on operation (e.g., transmitter 
power) to reduce the likelihood of interference.
The PARS rules have evolved considerably over the years as demand for paging service has 
increased while demand for the older type of non-cellular analog mobile telephone service has 
declined with the advent of cellular service.  The PARS rules originally provided for two-way 
mobile radiotelephone service with paging allowed on a secondary basis, but they have evolved 
to focus primarily upon paging.  There are also rules pertaining to the operation of internal point-
to-point and point-to-multipoint fixed links that are essential for local and regional paging 
systems.  
Currently, Part 22, subpart E is organized into six groups of rules.  The first (sections 22.501-
22.529) is a group of rules applying to all PARS stations.   Each of the subsequent five groups 
contains technical and operational rules pertaining only to a particular type of operation on 
specified channels.  The types of operation are paging (sections 22.531-22.559),  one- and two-
way mobile (sections 22.561-22.589),  point-to-point (sections 22.591-22.603),  point-to-
multipoint (sections 22.621-22.627),  and trunked mobile operation (sections 22.651-22.659).   
Some of the PARS 454-459 MHz channels are shared with basic exchange telephone radio 
systems (providing Rural Radiotelephone Service) and potentially with non-geostationary low 
earth orbit ("Little LEO") satellite downlinks.
Purpose
The purpose of subpart E is to facilitate the provision of commercial one-way and two-way 
wireless telecommunications services, in particular, one-way paging, to the general public at 
reasonable rates by:  (1) utilizing a competitive bidding process to issue exclusive licenses to the 
service provider applicants who value them most; (2) preserving and enhancing competition 
between these service providers once licensed; (3) ensuring that available spectrum allocations 
are used efficiently; and (4) reducing the likelihood of harmful interference among licensed 
stations.
Analysis
Status of Competition
PARS stations governed by subpart E compete directly with Part 90 commercial paging services 
and with Part 24 narrowband PCS, and they compete indirectly with other CMRS.  The Fifth 
Competition Report notes that one-way paging service subscribership appears to have peaked in 
1999, and is now declining.   Analysts believe that this trend is the result of declining prices for 
alternative options, such as cellular and broadband PCS services, which include paging, voice 
mail and text messaging capabilities.  Paging providers that have sufficient spectrum are 
attempting to reposition themselves in the market as wireless data providers. 
Advantages
The PARS rules provide a clear, predictable regulatory structure for the assignment and use of the 
spectrum allocated to PARS service.  Provision for accepting competing mutually exclusive 
applications and selecting the licensee by means of competitive bidding results in licenses being 
issued to the entities that value them the most.  Geographic area licensing minimizes the 
administrative burden involved in obtaining a license.  The technical rules are flexible enough to 
allow transition to narrowband technology capable of providing wireless data services.
Disadvantages
The PARS rules impose some burdens related to compliance with technical and operational rules.  
Although the Commission converted the authorization of the PARS from the original site-by-site 
procedure to a geographic area licensing process, several detailed technical rules related to the 
site-by-site procedure have been retained in order to protect the investment of grandfathered 
incumbent licensees in areas where the geographic licensee is a different entity.
Recent Efforts
The Commission made significant changes to its Part 22 subpart E rules during the last decade.  
In WT Docket No. 96-18, the Commission converted the authorization of stations in the PARS 
from the original site-by-site procedure to a geographic area licensing process.   More recently, 
most of the application filing rules were moved from this subpart to Part 1 in connection with 
implementation of electronic filing procedures and the Universal Licensing System. 
Recommendation
Most of the remaining rules in Part 22, subpart E are technical rules that are integral to the basic 
spectrum management function of the Commission, e.g., reducing the likelihood of harmful 
interference between PARS licenses.  The necessity for these technical rules is not significantly 
affected by changes in the level of competition in these services or CMRS generally.  Moreover, 
as noted above, the Commission has recently made significant revisions that restructured and 
streamlined the Part 22 licensing rules.  However, in view of the trends in paging and other 
CMRS services, the staff recommends that the Commission consider, inter alia, eliminating the 
following rules: 
? Limits on the number of paging channels that a licensee can obtain in the same area 
at one time.
? Rules that impose operational burdens, such as station identification requirements, 
where the advance of technology may have made the cost of the rule exceed the 
benefit.  
? 470-512 MHz Trunked Mobile Operation rules (sections 22.651 through 22.659).  
The availability of cellular service has made limited local trunked radiotelephone 
systems obsolete and the Commission has phased out this type of operation on this 
frequency band.  
? Rules related specifically to services and technologies that were never implemented 
or have gone out of use (e.g., sections 22.161, 22.603).

PART 22, SUBPART F - RURAL RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE
Description
Part 22 subpart F  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Rural 
Radiotelephone (Rural Radio) Service.  The rules contain provisions governing eligibility, 
assignment of channels, and management of interference. 
Rural Radio service is the only service regulated under Part 22 that is a fixed, rather than mobile, 
service.  Rural Radio service makes basic telephone service available to persons who live in 
remote rural locations where it is not feasible, because of cost, environmental factors, or other 
practical concerns, to provide such service by wire.  The rules provide that Rural Radio 
interoffice stations can also be used to link central offices where wireline links are similarly 
infeasible.
Two types of facilities are authorized in the Rural Radio service - conventional Rural Radio 
stations and basic exchange telephone radio systems (BETRS).  Both types may be licensed on 
channel pairs in the high VHF (152-158 MHz) and low UHF (454-459 MHz) bands that are also 
allocated on a co-primary basis to the Paging and Radiotelephone service.   This co-primary 
allocation has worked over the years because there is little demand for paging service in the 
remote areas where Rural Radio service is needed, and likewise there is no need for Rural Radio 
service in suburban and urban areas where paging services are in demand.  In WT Docket 96-18, 
the Commission provided for geographic area licensing of these bands for both paging and Rural 
Radio purposes.   However, because Rural Radio operators may seek to serve only a small 
portion of a geographic licensing area, the Commission also adopted a rule provision allowing 
Rural Radio licensees to operate individual sites on a secondary basis. 
Conventional Rural Radio stations may be licensed to any existing or proposed common carrier.  
These stations operate on exclusively assigned paired channels and are considered for regulatory 
purposes to be interconnected to, but not a part of, the local loop.  Consequently, conventional 
Rural Radio stations do not have to meet state requirements affecting the local loop (e.g., call 
blocking, transmission quality).  Conventional stations use traditional analog FM technology and 
provide one telephone line per assigned channel pair.  Often, two or more subscribers share 
service from a single Rural Radio station, party-line fashion.
Unlike conventional Rural Radio, BETRS facilities may only be licensed to entities that have 
been state certified to provide local exchange service in the geographic area in question (e.g., 
LECs and CLECs).  BETRS also operate on exclusively assigned paired channels, but they are 
considered, for regulatory purposes, to be a part of the local loop, and therefore must meet state 
standards applicable to the local loop.  BETRS systems typically use digital TDMA technology 
that allows 2 or 4 independent (i.e., private) telephone lines per assigned channel pair.
Purpose
The purpose of the Rural Radio rules is to facilitate provision of basic telephone service to 
persons who live in remote rural locations where it is not feasible to provide such service by wire. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
The Rural Radio service was established in the 1970s to provide an extension of, rather than 
competition for, regular wireline local loop service.  It is generally used only as a last resort in the 
most remote rural areas where wireline telephone service is not feasible or cost-effective.  Rural 
Radio frequencies offer very limited traffic capacity, which would not be sufficient to provide 
viable telephony competition in suburban and urban areas, where these channels are primarily 
used by paging carriers.  Historically, Rural Radio customers have had few if any competitive 
alternatives for provision of telephony due to their geographic isolation.  More recently, however, 
other wireless services, such as cellular and PCS, have begun to expand into areas served by 
Rural Radio, and availability of competitive alternatives is likely to increase in the future.  
Advantages
The rules in Part 22, subpart F provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of 
the spectrum co-allocated to the Rural Radio service to provide basic telephone service to persons 
who live in remote rural locations.
Disadvantages
As discussed below, some of the rules concerning Rural Radio appear to have become outdated as 
a result of technological developments since the rules were adopted.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission has not recently revised the Rural Radio rules other than to establish geographic 
licensing rules, as discussed above. 
Recommendation
In general, the staff recommends retention of the Rural Radio rules.  However, some of these 
rules appear to have become outdated.  Sections 22.417, 22.727, and 22.729  provide for the use 
of certain low VHF (44 MHz) channels for meteor-burst Rural Radio stations.  It appears that 
these sections have not been used for many years, probably because of the availability of better 
alternatives in Alaska.  The Commission should attempt to determine whether there are any such 
systems still in operation and, if not, propose to remove the meteor burst provisions.
Section 22.757  provides a limited allocation of private radio channels in the high UHF band 
(816-865 MHz) for BETRS use in certain areas.  These have never been applied for or used for 
BETRS because of their limited geographic availability, and because there is no equipment 
suitable for BETRS in this band.  Also, the private radio rules governing these channels have 
been substantially changed since this allocation was made.  The Commission should consider 
removing this allocation from the Rural Radio service.

PART 22, SUBPAR T G - AIR-GROUND RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE
Description
Part 22, subpart G  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Air-Ground 
Radiotelephone Service ("AGS").  AGS provides commercial telephone service to persons in 
airborne aircraft, using telephone instruments that are permanently mounted in the aircraft. 
AGS consists of two separate parts:  General Aviation air-ground stations and Commercial 
Aviation air-ground systems.  General Aviation air-ground stations are permitted to serve only 
"general aviation" aircraft, which are aircraft owned by individuals or businesses for their own 
use that do not carry passengers for hire.  General Aviation air-ground stations were first 
established in the late 1960s and operate in the 454-459 MHz range.  General Aviation ground 
stations operate independently rather than as a system.  Consequently, when an aircraft flies out 
of range of a ground station, any call in progress disconnects, and the user  must then redial 
through another ground station.  There are about 86 operational ground stations in the U.S.
Commercial Aviation air-ground systems are permitted to serve any type of aircraft, but primarily 
serve passengers aboard commercial airlines.  Commercial Aviation systems use seat-back and 
bulkhead-mounted telephones commonly seen on commercial flights.  These systems were 
established in the 1980s and operate in the 850-895 MHz range.  Commercial aviation air-ground 
systems are all nationwide systems and calls in progress hand-off from one ground station to 
another uninterrupted as the aircraft flies across the country.
In general, the subpart G rules:  (1) specify the frequency bands allocated to the General Aviation 
and Commercial Aviation air-ground services; (2) provide separation distance criteria for 
determining where new ground stations may be established; (3) establish minimum construction 
or coverage requirements for licensees; and (4) set forth certain technical limits on operation 
(e.g., transmitter power).
Purpose
The purpose of subpart G is to facilitate the provision of commercial telephone service to persons 
aboard airborne aircraft.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
The number of carriers providing AGS is small and most wireless carriers consider it to be a 
"niche" market.  The principal operators of General Aviation stations are M-Tel and the successor 
companies of the Bell Operating companies, most notably Airtouch (now Verizon), though other, 
smaller operators exist also.  Although more than one provider can share each ground station 
control channel pair,  few if any locations appear to have competing providers. 
The 850-895 MHz frequencies used by Commercial Aviation air-ground systems can 
accommodate up to six competing systems, but only three of the six initial licensees ever 
constructed their systems.   Of these three, one (In-Flight Corporation) has gone out of business, 
so that only two carriers (GTE Airfone and Claircom, operated by AT&T Wireless) remain in 
operation. 
Another potential source of competition in the air-ground sector may be provided by Aircell, 
which does not operate on AGS frequencies, but was granted a waiver in 1998 to provide air-
ground service using specialized equipment that operates on cellular frequencies. 
Advantages
The AGS rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of the air-ground 
spectrum allocation.
Disadvantages
The AGS rules include highly specific requirements for the technical configuration of air-ground 
systems and the use of air-ground channels that may inhibit licensee flexibility and technical 
innovation. 
Recommendation
The subpart G rules were largely adopted in the 1980s, and have not been significantly revised 
since.  Air-ground service is also affected by technical and competitive considerations that are 
distinct from terrestrial CMRS.  The staff therefore recommends that the Commission consider 
initiating a proceeding that would comprehensively review our air-ground rules in light of current 
technology and competitive conditions.  Potential goals of such a proceeding would include:  (1) 
adopting rules that foster competition by eliminating unnecessary barriers to entry; (2) 
eliminating rules that freeze technological advancement; and (3) providing incentives for existing 
terrestrial CMRS licensees to provide air-ground service.


PART 22, SUBPART H- CELLULAR RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE
Description
Part 22, subpart H  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service ("cellular service").  This service was created in 1981 as an automated, 
high-capacity, nationwide-compatible mobile telephone service.   
The spectrum allocated to the cellular service is divided into two channel blocks, A and B.  This 
was done to provide for two competing facilities-based providers in each licensing area.  Initially, 
the cellular license for the B channel block in each licensing area was issued to the wireline 
telephone company in that area and the license for the A channel block issued to a company other 
than that wireline telephone company.  Because there were multiple A block applicants in most 
markets, the initial licensee was selected by comparative hearings for the first (largest) 30 
markets, and random selection (lotteries) for the remaining markets.  After Congress gave the 
Commission authority to select among mutually exclusive applications using competitive bidding 
(auctions), the Commission began using auctions instead of lotteries in the cellular service.  
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many of the initial cellular licensees consolidated to form 
systems covering much larger geographical areas. 
In general, the rules in Part 22, subpart H:  (1) specify the frequency bands allocated to the 
cellular service; (2) provide methods for determining the Cellular Geographic Service Area 
(protected service area) of each system; (3) establish minimum construction and coverage 
requirements for cellular licensees; and (4) set forth certain technical limits on operation (e.g., 
transmitter power).
Purpose
The purpose of subpart H is to facilitate the provision of commercial cellular services to the 
general public at reasonable rates, by:  (1) utilizing a competitive bidding process to issue 
exclusive licenses to the service provider applicants who value them most; (2) preserving and 
enhancing competition between these service providers once licensed; (3) ensuring that available 
spectrum allocations are used efficiently; and (4) requiring coordination procedures to prevent 
harmful interference among cellular systems.
Analysis
Status of Competition
As detailed in the Fifth Competition Report, CMRS providers operate in an environment that is 
marked by significant and increasing competition in mobile telephony, paging/messaging, and 
mobile data.   Cellular is by far the largest mobile radiotelephone service in terms of 
subscribers, but competing broadband PCS and enhanced SMR services are rapidly growing.  
Cellular systems compete with other mobile telephone services principally on the basis of pricing 
plans, geographical coverage, and operational features.
Advantages
The cellular rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of cellular 
spectrum.  Although initial cellular licenses have been issued in every market, an on-going 
process allows for the licensing of any areas remaining unserved in those markets after the initial 
licensee's build out period has expired.  The provision for accepting competing mutually 
exclusive applications for unserved areas and selecting the eventual licensee by means of 
competitive bidding results in licenses being issued to the entities that value them the most.  In 
addition, the rules contain minimal and flexible technical standards for alternative cellular 
technologies that facilitate the introduction of digital service and new features.
Disadvantages
The cellular rules impose some administrative burdens inherent in the licensing process and 
compliance with technical and operational rules.  However, some of the subpart H rules appear to 
be outdated in light of the current state of cellular technology and wireless competition.  For 
example, subpart H contains regulations to prevent speculation and trafficking in cellular licenses, 
which were adopted at the time that cellular licenses were awarded by lottery.  These rules appear 
to be anachronistic now that cellular licenses are awarded by auction.  
In addition, although there are only minimal technical rules governing alternative cellular 
technologies, such as the digital modes and data services, subpart H continues to contain technical 
rules for the provision of analog service ("Advanced Mobile Phone Service" or "AMPS").  These 
rules are based on a 1981 technical compatibility specification, with numerous technical rules 
governing everything from call processing algorithms to modulation filter performance.  As a 
result, these AMPS technical requirements are at least 15 years out of date. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission has made significant changes to its Part 22 rules in recent years, mainly in the 
areas of increasing spectrum use flexibility  and streamlining the licensing process to 
incorporate electronic filing procedures and the Universal Licensing System.   Currently, the 
staff is preparing for the Commission's consideration proposals to eliminating cellular technical 
and administrative rules that have become obsolete because increased competition has caused 
technology to evolve at a rapid pace.
Recommendation
Many of the rules in Part 22, subpart H are integral to basic spectrum management functions of 
the Commission, such as requiring that spectrum assignments be put to full and efficient use.  The 
necessity for some of these rules is not significantly affected by changes in the level of 
competition in wireless services.  
However, as noted above, subpart H also contains a number of relatively old rules, particularly 
technical rules applicable to cellular service, that were adopted when wireless technology and 
competitive conditions were very different from the present day.  In addition, certain rules (e.g., 
rules requiring demonstration of an applicant's financial qualifications) were adopted in 
connection with the use of lotteries to award licenses, which has been superseded by the use of 
competitive bidding.  
Therefore, the staff recommends that as part of the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review, the 
Commission should undertake a comprehensive review of the subpart H rules.  In accordance, 
with this recommendation, the staff is preparing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would 
consider, inter alia:
Whether to modify or eliminate, the rule requiring demonstration 
of financial qualifications by cellular applicants,  which was 
more appropriate under prior applicant selection systems such as 
random selection lotteries.  
Whether to modify or eliminate the rule requiring cellular 
systems to operate in conformance with the 1981 AMPS 
compatibility specification,  and various other technical rules 
that have become obsolete due to the rapid evolution of 
technology. 
Whether to privatize the assignment of system identification 
numbers.  The manufacturing industry has recently formed an 
organization to manage and administer handset manufacturer 
codes, which was formerly done by the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau.

PART 22, SUBPART I - OFFSHORE RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE
Description
Part 22, subpart I  governs the licensing and operation of offshore radiotelephone stations.  The 
Offshore Radiotelephone Service allows Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) providers to 
use conventional duplex analog technology to provide telephone service to subscribers located on 
(or in helicopters en route to) oil exploration and production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Those using this service are licensed to operate in the paired 476/479 and 489/493 MHz bands in 
three zones comprising Louisiana and Texas, depending on the longitude.  The channels were 
taken from UHF-TV Channels 15 and 17. 
Purpose
The purpose of the subpart I rules is to establish basic rules and procedures for the licensing and 
operation of offshore radiotelephone stations.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
There are several competitive alternatives to Offshore Radiotelephone service in the Gulf.  Two 
cellular companies currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA), and some 
SMR service providers also operate there on a site-by-site basis.  The Commission is also 
considering licensing in the Gulf in several other spectrum bands, including PCS and the 700 
MHz band.   
Advantages
The subpart I rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of Offshore 
Radio spectrum.   
Disadvantages
The subpart I rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent in the 
licensing process and compliance with technical and operational rules.  
Recent Efforts
The rules in this subpart have not been revised since 1995.
Recommendation 
In general, the rules in this part are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  Therefore, the staff concludes that significant 
modification or repeal of the subpart I rules is not necessary at this time.

PART 22, SUBPART J - REQUIRED NEW CAPABILITIES PURSUANT TO THE 
COMMUNICATIONS ASSISTANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT (CALEA)
Description
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) was enacted by Congress 
to establish procedures for law enforcement to obtain authorized access to wireless and wireline 
communications or call-identifying information where such information is needed for law 
enforcement purposes.    Part 22, subpart J  contains technical standards and capabilities for 
cellular carriers to ensure that communications and call-identifying information will be accessible 
to law enforcement, as required by section 103 of CALEA.   These rules were adopted in 
1999.   The Commission has adopted parallel requirements and standards for broadband PCS 
licensees in Part 24, subpart J  and for wireline telecommunications carriers in Part 64, subpart 
W. 
Purpose
The purpose of the CALEA rules is to ensure that law enforcement, pursuant to court order or 
other lawful authorization, will have reasonable access to wireless and wireline communications 
or call-identifying information where such information is needed for law enforcement purposes. 
Analysis
Advantages
These rules arose from the Commission's specific statutory role as arbiter of differences among 
industry, law enforcement, and other interested parties regarding standards for complying with 
section 103 of CALEA.  In large part, they reflect the consensus reached during the standard-
setting process, as modified through application of the Commission's expertise in areas where 
consensus was not reached.
Disadvantages
The CALEA rules impose technical burdens on carriers to comply with the accessibility 
requirements of the statute, and may limit technical flexibility and innovation.
Recent Efforts
On August 15, 2000, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded for further explanation the CALEA 
rules insofar as they imposed certain capability requirements in excess of industry-adopted 
technical standards.  
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission reconsider its capability standards in light of the D.C. 
Circuit's remand. 

PART 23 - INTERNATIONAL FIXED PUBLIC RADIOCOMMUNICATION SERVICES
Description
Part 23 implements and interprets sections 4, 301, and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended.   Part 23 sets forth rules applicable to high frequency ("HF") radio systems used 
for international communications, including general licensing and service rules, application filing 
requirements, and technical specifications.  The rules classify these systems as either "fixed 
public service" (a radiocommunication service carried on between fixed stations open to public 
correspondence) or "fixed public press service" (a radiocommunication service carried on 
between point-to-point telegraph stations, open to limited public correspondence of news items or 
other material related to or intended for publication by press agencies, newspapers, or for public 
dissemination).
Although Part 23 does not contain lettered sub-parts, the rules are organized as follows:
		Section 23.1			Definitions
Sections 23.11-23.12		Use of frequencies
Sections 23.13-23.19		Technical specifications
Sections 23.20-23.27		Use of frequencies
Sections 23.28-23.55		Licensing and service rules

Purpose
The Commission has stated that the original purpose of the Part 23 rules is "obscure."  Western 
Union Telegraph Co., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 75 F.C.C.2d 461, 472  39 (1980) 
(Western Union MO&O).  Neither the Federal Communications Commission nor the Federal 
Radio Commission has issued any opinion explaining the rationale for the rules.  See id. (research 
updated as of December 12, 1979).  The FCC has not opined on these rules since the Western 
Union MO&O.
In the Western Union MO&O, the Commission stated that the rules contained in Part 23 derive 
from those promulgated by the Federal Radio Commission in 1932.  At that time, fixed wireless 
links presumably provided an important method of communications between: (1) the contiguous 
48 States (including D.C.) and Alaska, Hawaii, any U.S. possession, or any foreign point; (2) 
Alaska and any other point; (3) Hawaii and any other point; and (4) any U.S. possession and any 
other point.  Part 23 provides the regulatory framework for these services.  In addition, Part 23 
governs radiocommunication within the contiguous 48 States (including D.C.) in connection with 
relaying the above-referenced international traffic.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Use of HF radio facilities in providing carriers' international communications services in the age 
of submarine cable and satellites is virtually dormant.  There are two active Part 23 licensees, 
with a recently-filed Part 23 application - the first in several years - still pending.  Competition 
among services under this rule Part is therefore not relevant.
Advantages
Part 23 provides the requisite framework within which licensees can perform useful functions in 
the provision of international communications services.  HF radio stations can be a functionally 
useful supplement to submarine cable and satellite systems in the provision of service to overseas 
points not easily or economically reached by these facilities, in the provision of a limited restoral 
capability during submarine cable or satellite outages, and in the provision of certain specialized 
services such as press and weather map broadcast services.  
Disadvantages
Because the type of international traffic addressed in these rules now is carried primarily by 
undersea cable and satellite, there is considerably less need for regulation in this area.
Recent Efforts
None.
Recommendation
Part 23 is ripe for streamlining or elimination.  However, the staff recommends that Part 23 be 
retained in its entirety pending an in-depth Commission review to determine how the few 
remaining licensees are using this service and to project when submarine cable and satellite will 
fully supplant this service.  Should the Commission determine that this service warrants 
continued regulation, the staff recommends the repeal of Part 23, with the necessary regulatory 
mechanisms (most likely, technical standards) incorporated into Part 90 or Part 101, each of 
which regulates similar services.  

PART 24 - PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Description
Part 24  contains licensing, technical, operational, and auction rules for broadband and 
narrowband Personal Communications Services (PCS).   The rules in this part: (1) define PCS 
licensing areas; (2) specify the frequencies available to PCS licensees; (3) establish license terms 
and operational parameters; (4) set forth minimum coverage requirements for licensees; (5) 
establish minimum technical standards and limits on operation (e.g., antenna height, transmitter 
power) to prevent interference; and (6) set forth application procedures and  competitive bidding 
rules for the auction and award of PCS licenses.  
In addition, subpart J contains requirements applicable to PCS under the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).   Specifically, these rules set forth certain 
capability standards applicable to broadband PCS telecommunications carriers in order to ensure 
that, when properly authorized, law enforcement has access to communications or call-identifying 
information.
Part 24 is organized into ten lettered sub-parts:

A - General Information 
B - Applications and Licenses
C - Technical Standards
D - Narrowband PCS 
E - Broadband PCS 
F - Competitive Bidding Procedures for Narrowband PCS
G - Interim Application, Licensing and Processing Rules for Narrowband PCS
H - Competitive Bidding Procedures for Broadband PCS
I - Interim Application, Licensing and Processing Rules for Broadband PCS
J - Required New Capabilities Pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law 
Enforcement Act (CALEA)
The Part 24 rules were initially adopted in 1993,  and were modified on reconsideration in 
1994.   The Commission has recently issued an order further revising certain aspects of the Part 
24 narrowband PCS rules.   The CALEA rules were adopted in a separate proceeding in 1999. 
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 24 rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of PCS 
spectrum, to ensure efficient spectrum use by PCS licensees, and to prevent interference.  In 
addition, Part 24 contains rules that define eligibility for the PCS entrepreneurs' blocks and for 
"designated entity" (i.e., small business) status within these blocks.  The purpose of these 
provisions is to implement the objectives of section 309(j)(3) of the Communications Act  that 
the distribution of PCS licenses is not excessively concentrated, and that small businesses, rural 
telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities will have opportunities to 
participate in the provision of PCS.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Broadband PCS providers primarily offer mobile telephony service in competition with cellular 
and some SMR services.  As described in the Fifth Competition Report, the broadband PCS 
sector has contributed to a significant increase in competition in the mobile telephony market 
since the first broadband PCS providers were licensed five years ago.   However, broadband 
PCS has not yet achieved the same level of geographic coverage or subscribership as cellular, 
particularly in smaller markets. 
Narrowband PCS providers primarily offer two-way messaging and services.  They compete with 
a rapidly proliferating array of other messaging and mobile data services, including paging and 
wireless Internet services. 
Advantages
The Part 24 rules provide the basic regulatory structure necessary for the orderly assignment and 
use of PCS spectrum, while otherwise affording licensees substantial flexibility to determine what 
technology, type of service, and business strategy they will use.  The Part 24 competitive bidding 
rules promote efficient licensing of PCS spectrum to those entities that value it the most. 
Disadvantages
The Part 24 rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent in the 
licensing process and compliance with technical and operational rules. 
Recent Efforts
In an order adopted May 5, 2000, the Commission revised its narrowband PCS rules to eliminate 
certain regulatory burdens and afford narrowband PCS licensees greater flexibility than was 
provided under the original Part 24 rules.   Specifically, the Commission:  (1) provided for use 
of larger licensing areas for the remaining narrowband PCS spectrum;  (2) eliminated the limit on 
aggregation of narrowband PCS licenses; (3) eliminated technical restrictions and eligibility 
limitations on paging response channels; (4) adopted a "substantial service" alternative to existing 
construction and minimum coverage requirements; and (5) adopted partitioning and 
disaggregation rules.  
On June 7, 2000, the Commission initiated a rulemaking to consider possible modifications to its 
entrepreneur eligibility rules for the C and F blocks in anticipation of the auction later this year of 
C and F block spectrum that has reverted to the Commission.   On August 29, 2000, the 
Commission released the Sixth Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration in WT Docket 
No. 97-82, in which it reconfigured the available C block licenses into 10 MHz blocks and 
removed the entrepreneur eligibility restrictions with respect to certain reconfigured C block 
licenses and all F block licenses. 
Recommendation
In general, the Part 24 rules are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for such rules is also not significantly 
affected by changes in the level of competition in PCS or in wireless services generally.  
Therefore, with certain exceptions noted below, the staff concludes that significant modification 
or repeal of the licensing and technical rules in Part 24 is not necessary at this time.  
Part 24 contains two subparts (subparts G and I) that set forth "interim application, licensing, and 
processing rules" for narrowband and broadband PCS, respectively.  Many of these rules appear 
to be duplicative of the consolidated Part 1, subpart F rules that establish licensing procedures for 
all wireless services.  In addition, a number of the competitive bidding provisions in Part 24 have 
been superseded by recent amendments to the general competitive bidding rules of Part 1, subpart 
Q.  For example, Part 24 provisions addressing (1) competitive bidding design, (2) withdrawal, 
default and disqualification penalties, and (3) upfront, down and installment payments, have been 
replaced by updated provisions in Part 1, subpart Q.  Therefore, the continued presence of 
service-specific auction rules in Part 24 appears to be redundant.  The staff recommends that 
consideration be given to eliminating or phasing out these rules.


PART 25 - SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
Description
Part 25 was issued pursuant to the authority contained in section 201(c)(11) of the 
Communications Satellite Act of 1962, as amended, section 501(c)(6) of the International 
Maritime Satellite Telecommunications Act, and titles I through III of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended.  Part 25 sets out the rules applicable to satellite communications, including 
general licensing and application filing requirements, technical standards, and technical 
operations.
Part 25 is organized into seven lettered sub-parts:

A - General
B - Applications and Licenses
C - Technical Standards
D - Technical Operations
E - Reserved
F - Competitive Bidding Procedures for DARS
G - Reserved
H - Authorization to Own Stock in the Communications Satellite Corporation
I - Equal Employment Opportunities

Purpose
Part 25 provides rules under which the Bureau licenses systems to provide various satellite 
services.  The rules are designed to accommodate efficiently the maximum number of systems 
possible for each type of service, to enhance competition for satellite services and the terrestrial 
services with which they compete.  Sections of Part 25 also have provisions:  (1) to protect 
against impermissible levels of interference; (2) to assure compliance with international 
agreements and treaties; (3) to assure the timely construction and operation of authorized earth 
stations and the timely construction, launch and operation of authorized space stations; (4) to 
assure the timely provision of sufficient information to allow for processing of applications; and 
(5) to assure compliance with license specifications and conditions as well as with Commission 
rules and regulations.  In addition, Part 25 provides competitive bidding procedures for the 
provision of DARS services, and specifies the procedure by which the Commission authorizes the 
purchase of stock in COMSAT.  Part 25 also provides for preemption of local zoning of earth 
stations, unless the reasonableness of the regulation can be demonstrated.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The satellite services regulated by Part 25 are fully competitive on most routes.  There are four 
major satellite service providers and several smaller providers that are licensed to provide state-
of-the-art satellite telephony and data services to U.S. consumers and consumers worldwide.  On 
many routes, satellite telephony and data services are offered by several satellite providers.  In 
addition, these satellite service providers face competition from terrestrial service providers for 
some services on some routes.  The Commission's rules and policies have led to the competitive 
industry that we see today by encouraging satellite companies to "pack" the satellite orbits and 
maximize the use of frequencies available at those orbital locations.  Part 25 rules also provide 
licensing mechanisms for future entry and further competition in these services.  The rules also 
contain criteria to permit foreign entry into the U.S. markets to further compete for U.S. 
consumers.
Advantages
General Applications Filing Requirements:  Part 25 provides clear procedures for filing 
applications, and predictable procedures for evaluating whether applications are complete.  Part 
25 also provides clear and predictable procedures for amendments, modifications, assignments 
and transfers.  In addition, section 25.120 provides effective procedures for handling applications 
for special temporary authorization when delay would seriously prejudice the public interest.  
This allows for a more efficient use of resources.
Earth Stations:  Sections 25.130 through 25.137 include procedures that allow for a frequency 
coordination analysis to reduce interference and the verification of earth station antenna 
performance standards.  These clear procedures minimize the cost associated with reducing 
interference.  Provisions in Part 25 also assure compliance with international agreements and 
treaties.  Section 25.133 includes requirements for the timely construction and operation of earth 
stations.  By reducing the likelihood that resources will be allocated to "phantom" ventures, 
section 25.133 assures that unnecessary costs were not imposed on other services that would have 
been limited by the need for coordination to reduce interference with systems that are, in fact, not 
implemented.
Space Stations:  Sections 25.140 through 25.145 include conditions to facilitate coordination to 
avoid harmful interference to other systems.  These sections also outline conditions for 
qualification as an applicant, which enhances the likelihood that the proposed systems will be 
constructed, launched and operated if licensed.  These conditions reduce the likelihood that 
unnecessary costs will be imposed on other services through coordination to reduce interference.  
Section 25.140 also includes limitations on the number of orbital locations that can be assigned to 
each applicant, thereby fostering competition and reducing the likelihood of anti-competitive 
behavior.
Processing of Applications and Forfeiture, Termination, and Reinstatement of Station 
Authorizations:  Sections 25.150 through 25.163 include well-defined procedures for processing 
applications to determine whether the applications are mutually exclusive.  These sections also 
maximize compliance with Commission rules and minimize enforcement costs.
Subpart C-Technical Standards and Subpart D-Technical Operations:  These subparts provide 
clear and predictable technical standards and operating rules to minimize interference.
Subpart F-Competitive Bidding Procedures for DARS:  This subpart describes a mechanism for 
competitive bidding for satellite DARS service.  Competitive bidding promotes competition and 
awards DARS licenses to those firms that will most efficiently use those resources to compete in 
providing service.  Competitive bidding is more efficient than other forms of assignment.
Subpart H-Authorization to Own Stock in the Communications Satellite Corporation:  These 
rules provide the procedure for the administration of section 304 of the Communications Satellite 
Act of 1962.  With the signing of the ORBIT Act Pub. Law No. 106-180, 114 Stat. 4B (2000), 
earlier this year, section 304 of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 ceases to be effective. 
Subpart I-Equal Employment Opportunities:  This section promotes diversity in employment 
and creates opportunities.
Disadvantages
Earth Stations:  Some limitations included in these rules might hamper the introduction of new 
services.  For example, it may be possible to relax the threshold technical rules that trigger inter-
system coordination among satellite service providers and reduce the burden on coordinating new 
and innovative satellite technologies. 
Space Stations:  Section 25.140 requires a demonstration that an applicant is legally, financially, 
technically and otherwise qualified to proceed expeditiously to operate the proposed space 
station, and outlines the information required to make this demonstration.  If the qualifications are 
too restrictive, some applicants that would be able to offer service expeditiously would be 
eliminated from the pool of potential satellite service providers, which may result in reduced 
competition.  In addition, section 25.140 limits the allocation of orbital slots to each applicant, 
which can restrict the introduction of new services.  The radio-determination satellite service 
spectrum described in section 25.141 has been reallocated to MSS, and the rules in this section no 
longer serve any purpose.  Section 25.144 includes licensing provisions for satellite digital audio 
radio service, and specifies the applicants eligible for the auction.  This rule, too, serves no 
purpose because the auction has already been held and the pool of applicants is overtaken by 
events.
Processing of Applications and Forfeiture, Termination, and Reinstatement of Station 
Authorizations:  The preparation of applications and the delay associated with public comment 
periods and the examination of applications can be costly to applicants.
Subpart C-Technical Standards and Subpart D-Technical Operations:  These standards and 
operating rules, while preserving the operating environment today, could hamper the introduction 
of new services and restrict alternative uses of resources in the future.
Subpart F-Competitive Bidding Procedures for DARS:  Satellite services in unplanned 
frequency bands require international coordination prior to the commencement of operations.  
The value of the orbital location resource is uncertain if the international coordination process has 
not yet been completed.
Subpart H-Authorization to Own Stock in the Communications Satellite Corporation: These 
rules ceased to be effective with the recent signing of the ORBIT Act.
Subpart I-Equal Employment Opportunities:  Rules in this section might increase operating 
costs.
Recent Efforts
As described in the staff report, the Commission has taken and continues to take steps to 
streamline both the earth station and space station portions of its satellite licensing process and to 
provide earth station applicants with greater flexibility.  The staff is reviewing the technical and 
operational standards contained in Part 25.
Recommendation
The staff recommends further streamlining of its earth station and space station licensing 
processes.  The staff recommends that the Commission commence a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comment on industry proposals for comprehensive changes in the 
earth station licensing process.  It also recommends that the Commission seek comment on 
requiring electronic filing, which could save substantial time in processing applications.  In 
addition, the staff recommends that the Bureau continue working with industry to re-examine the 
entire satellite network licensing process.
Furthermore, the staff recommends repealing section 25.141 and subpart H of the Commission's 
rules.  The staff recommends review of the financial qualification rules in section 25.140 to 
determine if the financial qualification rules are necessary, and if a different showing of financial 
qualification might be appropriate.

PART 26 - GENERAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Description
Part 26  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for General Wireless 
Communications Services (GWCS) in the 4660-4685 MHz band.  The rules in this part: (1) 
define permissible communications; (2) establish license terms and parameters; (3) establish 
minimum technical standards and limits on operation (e.g.,antenna height, emission limits) to 
prevent interference; (4) define GWCS service areas; and (5) set forth application procedures and 
competitive bidding rules for the auction and award of GWCS licenses.  
The Commission adopted the Part 26 rules in the 1995 GWCS Second Report and Order.  The 
rules allow GWCS licensees to provide any fixed or mobile communications service on their 
assigned spectrum.  Broadcasting, radiolocation, and satellite services are prohibited.  However, 
as discussed below, no licenses have been awarded in the service, the 4660-4685 MHz band has 
since been reclaimed by the federal government, and the Commission has proposed to delete the 
Part 26 rules.  
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 26 rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of spectrum in 
Part 26 services, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to prevent interference.  
Analysis
Status of Competition 
No licenses have been awarded in the GWCS service.  The Commission contemplated that 
GWCS would accommodate a variety of fixed and mobile service uses, such as voice, video and 
data transmission, private microwave, broadcast auxiliary, and ground-to-air voice and video.   
In April 1998, however, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau postponed the GWCS auction 
scheduled for May 27, 1998 due to a lack of demand for licenses in the 4660-4685 MHz band.    
The lack of demand appeared to result from the relatively small size of the spectrum block and 
from potential interference problems due to U.S. Navy use of adjacent spectrum.  
Advantages
Not Applicable.  
Disadvantages
Not applicable.     
Recent Efforts
On March 30, 1999, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that the Federal 
Government was reclaiming the 4635-4685 MHz band and identified the 4.9 GHz band as 
substitute spectrum for private sector use.   Accordingly, on February 23, 2000, the Commission 
adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in WT Docket No. 00-32 proposing to eliminate the 
GWCS rules and delete Part 26.   In the Notice, the Commission states that it will allocate and 
establish licensing and service rules for the 4.9 GHz band as substitute spectrum.    In the 
Notice,  the Commission also proposes to license the 4.9 GHz band under Part 27 of the 
Commission's Rules. 
Recommendation
In light of the Commission's pending proposal in WT Docket No. 00-32 to delete the Part 26 
rules, the staff makes no recommendations with respect to these rules. 

PART 27 - MISCELLANEOUS WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Description
Part 27  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Wireless Communications 
Services (WCS) and for other new wireless services.  The rules in this part: (1) define WCS 
license areas; (2) specify the frequencies available to WCS licensees; (3) establish license terms 
and operational parameters; (4) establish minimum technical standards and limits on operation 
(e.g., antenna height, power limits) to prevent interference; and set forth application procedures 
and competitive bidding rules for the auction and award of WCS licenses. 
Part 27 is divided into six sub-parts:
	A - General Information
	B - Applications and Licenses
	C - Technical Standards
	D - Competitive Bidding Procedures for WCS
	E - Application, Licensing and Processing Rules for WCS
	F - Competitive Bidding Procedures for the 747-762 MHz and 777-792 MHz 
	      Bands

The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act (1997) directed the Commission to reallocate the 
2305-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz bands to wireless services and, among other things, to promote 
the most efficient use of the spectrum.   On February 19, 1997, the Commission adopted a 
Report and Order establishing the Wireless Communications Service (WCS) in these bands and 
establishing the Part 27 rules.   Pursuant to these rules, WCS licenses were auctioned in 1998.
More recently, the Commission has amended Part 27 to add new rules for wireless services that 
will operate in the 747-762 MHz and 777-792 MHz bands (700 MHz services).  In the 700 MHz 
First Report and Order, released on January 7, 2000, the Commission adopted rules for the 700 
MHz services that provide for the broadest possible use of this spectrum, consistent with 
principles of sound spectrum management.    However, the Commission also noted that the 746-
806 MHz band has historically been used exclusively by television stations (Channels 60-69).  
These incumbent broadcasters are permitted by statute to continue operations in this band until 
their markets are converted to digital television.  
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 27 rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of spectrum 
with respect to Part 27 services, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to prevent 
interference.  In addition, Part 27 contains rules that define eligibility for small business status 
within these blocks.  These provisions implement the objectives of section 309(j)(3) of the Act 
that the distribution of licenses not be excessively concentrated, and that small businesses, rural 
telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities have opportunities to 
participate in the provision of WCS and other wireless services. 
Analysis
Advantages
The Part 27 rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of spectrum 
while allowing for maximum service flexibility.  The service rules follow a flexible, market-
based approach that affords maximum flexibility to licensees to decide on development and 
deployment of new telecommunications services and products to consumers.  The rules also 
ensure that licensees are not constrained to a single use of this spectrum and, therefore, can offer 
a mix of services and technologies to their customers. 
Disadvantages
The Part 27 rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent in the 
licensing process and compliance with technical and operational rules. 
Recent Efforts
In the 700 MHz Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, released on June 30, 2000, the 
Commission has sought comment on specific issues relating to possible voluntary relocation of 
broadcast incumbents out of the 700 MHz band.    
On March 30, 1999, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that the Federal 
Government was reclaiming the 4635-4685 MHz band and identified the 4.9 GHz band as 
substitute spectrum for private sector use.   Accordingly, on February 23, 2000, the Commission 
adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in WT Docket No. 00-32, proposing to allocate and 
establish licensing and service rules for the 4.9 GHz band as substitute spectrum.    In the 
Notice, the Commission proposed to license the 4.9 GHz band under the Part 27 rules. 
Additionally, the Commission proposed to codify and conform certain rules for the 2.3 GHz band 
to provide for consistent regulation of Part 27 services. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends retaining the Part 27 rules. 

PART 32 - UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS
Description
Section 220 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Commission to 
prescribe a uniform system of accounts for telephone companies.   Part 32 of the Commission's 
rules implements section 220's mandate and contains the Uniform System of Accounts 
("USOA") for incumbent local exchange carriers.  The USOA is an historical financial 
accounting system that discloses the results of operational and financial events in a manner that 
enables both the companies' management and policy-making agencies to assess these results.  
The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in monetary terms, the company's basic 
transactions.  Like any accounting system, the Part 32 USOA consists of a chart of accounts that 
can be used to prepare balance sheets, income statements, and other financial reports.  To reflect 
what happens within the telecommunications industry on a consistent and continuing basis, the 
Part 32 USOA uses standard accounts and methods for preparing such accounts. 
Part 32 is organized into seven lettered sub-parts:

	A - Preface
	B - General Instructions
	C - Instructions for Balance Sheet Accounts
	D - Instructions for Revenue Accounts
	E - Instructions for Expense Accounts
	F - Instructions for Other Income Accounts
	G - Glossary

On a substantive level, the Part 32 USOA performs four general functions.  First, the Part 32 
USOA sets forth a standardized chart of accounts and thereby directs companies how to record 
certain transactions in their books of account.  Second, the Part 32 USOA establishes rules for a 
carrier's affiliate transactions.  Third, the Part 32 USOA specifies accounting treatment for 
depreciation expenses.  Finally, the Part 32 USOA requires carriers to maintain property records 
of all telecommunications plant in service.  
Purpose
The Part 32 USOA acts as a nonstructural safeguard to prevent an incumbent LEC from 
exercising its market power.  Specifically, through standardized accounting procedures, the Part 
32 USOA helps ensure that ratepayers of regulated services do not bear the costs and risks 
associated with an incumbent LEC's competitive operations.  In addition, the Part 32 USOA 
restrains an incumbent LEC's ability to charge monopoly prices because it provides ratepayers 
with information that can be used to pursue a complaint against unjust and unreasonable rates.
The USOA also provides the Commission, state commissions, ratepayers, consumer advocates, 
the financial community, and others with large carriers' financial performance results that are 
ultimately reflected in their rates for telecommunications services.  By providing a standardized 
means for analyzing an incumbent LEC's performance, the Part 32 USOA is a tool for the 
Commission's comparative analysis regulatory technique.  The Commission implemented the 
Part 32 USOA in large part to reduce the need for costly and time-consuming special studies that 
carriers performed for policy-making purposes, while at the same time to provide the 
Commission and others with information used to make decisions regarding telecommunications 
competition, universal service, separations, access charges, and other policy issues.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.
Advantages
As a nonstructural safeguard, the Part 32 USOA is a lower-cost alternative to structural separation 
as a means for preventing an incumbent LEC from exercising its market power.   With its level 
of accounting detail, the Part 32 USOA deters cost misallocations by providing the initial 
information needed to identify cross-subsidization.  In this way, regulated services are protected 
from bearing the costs of an incumbent LEC's competitive operations.
The Part 32 USOA clearly specifies the incumbent LEC's chart of accounts and the manner in 
which the carrier prepares such accounts.  The standardized approach lowers the Commission's 
costs of monitoring the industry and enforcing its rules.  Because the Part 32 USOA incorporates 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Part 32 reduces the carriers' cost of 
complying with the Commission's rules.  
Working in tandem with the Part 43 reporting requirements, the Part 32 USOA is a low-cost 
means to gather information in the market about financial performance of large incumbent 
LECs.   Policy-makers, ratepayers, and others can then use an incumbent LEC's accounting 
information to make more informed decisions.  The information is also used to support a viable 
and sufficient system of universal service support.  Finally, disclosure enables ratepayers to 
pursue complaints regarding unjust and unreasonable rates, and therefore lowers the 
Commission's costs of enforcing the Act.
Disadvantages
The Part 32 USOA may increase an incumbent LEC's cost of performing internal accounting 
services because it establishes record-keeping requirements and accounting procedures (e.g., 
depreciation studies) that may not be necessary in a competitive environment.  Because the 
Commission intended for Part 32 USOA to deter cross-subsidization largely in a rate-of-return 
environment, it established a level of accounting detail that serves as a starting point in 
identifying cross-subsidization.  As a result of competitive developments during the 1990s, Part 
32 may impose more burdensome information requirements on incumbent LECs than needed in 
light of the changing competitive landscape. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission revised its Part 32 rules during the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review.   In that 
proceeding, the Commission substantially streamlined its accounting requirements for mid-sized 
incumbent LECs.  The Commission also reduced accounting requirements on all incumbent LECs 
by eliminating certain accounts.
Through the on-going Comprehensive Review proceeding, the Commission is streamlining its 
Part 32 accounting rules as the industry becomes increasingly competitive.  The Comprehensive 
Review involves a two-phase approach during which the Commission is soliciting the views of 
the states, the industry, and the public in a series of public workshops (as well as through standard 
notice-and-comment cycles).
In Phase 1 of the Comprehensive Review, the Commission addressed accounting and reporting 
reform issues that could be implemented without delay.  In the Phase 1 Order, which the 
Commission released in March 2000, the Commission substantially reduced the level of 
accounting detail required in certain reports, eliminated pre-notification requirements, relaxed the 
cost allocation manual audit requirements, and streamlined a number of ARMIS reporting 
requirements. 
In Phase 2, the Commission will look to reducing accounting and reporting requirements for 
incumbent LECs as the industry becomes more competitive.  Phase 2 of the Comprehensive 
Review started in December 1999.  During the first quarter of 2000, Commission and state 
participants met numerous times to discuss the issues of most interest to all parties.  A series of 
five public workshops commenced on April 5, 2000.  These workshops provide an opportunity 
for all interested parties, state commissions, incumbent LECs, interexchange carriers, CLECs, and 
consumers to voice their opinions on accounting and reporting reform.
Recommendation
Pursuant to the Commission's comprehensive review of its accounting requirements, which it 
initiated in 1999, the staff recommends substantial reductions in the Commission's accounting 
requirements.  These regulatory changes are responsive to the competition that has developed in 
recent years.  For example, the staff recommends reducing the chart of accounts,  modifying 
expense limits,  eliminating outdated accounts,  and exempting certain transactions from the 
affiliate transactions rules.   As the telecommunications industry becomes increasingly 
competitive, the Commission should consider further reducing accounting requirements.

PART 36 - JURISDICTIONAL SEPARATIONS PROCEDURES
Description
In 1930, the Supreme Court, in the case of Smith v. Illinois, recognized the system of state and 
federal regulation of telecommunications, concluding that because interstate calls originate and 
terminate over local exchange plant, interstate charges should reflect some portion of the cost of 
local plant.   The Part 36 jurisdictional separations rules are part of the Commission's present-
day implementation of that decision.  The Part 36 rules contain procedures and standards for 
dividing telephone company investment, expenses, taxes and reserves between the state and 
federal jurisdictions.  In addition to allocating costs between the federal and state jurisdictions, 
Part 36 also serves a universal service function.  Specifically, Part 36 permits carriers that serve 
high-cost areas to allocate additional local loop costs to the interstate jurisdiction and to recover 
those costs through the high-cost universal service support mechanism, thus making intrastate 
telephone service in high-cost areas more affordable.  
Part 36 is organized into 7 lettered sub-parts:
	A - General
	B - Telecommunications Property
	C - Operating Revenues and Certain Income Accounts
	D - Operating Expenses and Taxes
	E - Reserves and Deferrals
	F - Universal Service Fund
	G - Lifeline Connection Assistance Expense Allocation

Purpose
Part 36 is intended to recognize the dual system of telecommunications regulation, with interstate 
calling regulated at the federal level.  Part 36 is intended to ensure that incumbent LECs are able 
to recover a portion of local exchange costs through interstate rates, since interstate long distance 
calls originate and terminate over these facilities.  It is also intended to prevent incumbent LECs 
from recovering the same costs through both interstate and intrastate rates.  The additional 
interstate cost allocation for high-cost areas is intended to foster universal service by ensuring that 
local exchange rates in such areas remain generally affordable.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas. 
Advantages 
The existing Part 36 separations rules facilitate state and federal common carrier rate regulation 
by dividing incumbent LEC costs between the two jurisdictions.  The division of costs between 
the state and federal jurisdictions is necessary for the calculation of state and federal earned rates 
of return.  Such earned rates of return are used in rate base rate of return regulation to determine 
whether earnings are excessive.  In price cap regulation, an earned rate of return is also calculated 
for purposes of the low-end adjustment.  The subpart F rules providing for an additional interstate 
cost allocation for high-cost areas promote universal service by keeping local exchange rates 
generally affordable in these areas.  
Disadvantages
The current jurisdictional separations rules may be unnecessarily complex and may impose some 
unnecessary recordkeeping burdens on incumbent LECs.
Recent Efforts
The Commission is currently in the process of considering separations reform in conjunction with 
a Federal-State Joint Board, made up of federal and state commissioners.  The Commission 
initiated this review with an Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 1997, requesting comment on the 
impact on jurisdictional separations of legislative, technological, and market changes, as well as 
several industry proposals for separations reform.   Most of the commenting parties supported 
continuation of some form of separations until the local exchange market is fully competitive, 
although there was a wide range of interim proposals.  On July 21, 2000, the Federal-State Joint 
Board on jurisdictional separations recommended that the Commission freeze the Part 36 plant 
category relationships  and the jurisdictional allocation factors on an interim basis until 
comprehensive reform of jurisdictional separations can be implemented. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends continuation of the on-going work on jurisdictional separations reform.  
The staff, however, does not recommend further review of the universal service provisions 
contained in Part 36 in the context of the current biennial regulatory review.  The staff 
recommends elimination of the subpart G lifeline provisions in Part 36, since they are no longer 
in effect and have been replaced by rules in Part 54.  There are also a number of other rules in 
Part 36 that can be eliminated because they are applicable to specific time periods that have since 
passed. 

PART 42 - PRESERVATION OF RECORDS OF COMMON CARRIERS
Description
Part 42 implements sections 219 and 220 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, which 
authorize the Commission to require communications common carriers to keep records and file 
reports.  Part 42 sets forth rules governing the preservation of records of communications 
common carriers, including all accounts, records, memoranda, documents, papers and 
correspondence prepared by or on behalf of such carriers.  It also requires non-dominant 
interexchange carriers to make available information concerning the rates, terms, and conditions 
for their services.
Purpose
Part 42 was designed to implement sections 219 and 220.  Part 42 was established to facilitate 
enforcement of the Communications Act by ensuring the availability of carrier records needed by 
the Commission to meet its regulatory obligations.  Part 42 is also intended to aid enforcement of 
criminal statutes by requiring the retention of telephone toll records.  In addition, Part 42 serves 
the public interest by giving consumers access to information about the rates, terms, and 
conditions for domestic, interstate, interexchange services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitors 
still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition for business customers in 
metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than competition for residential 
customers or customers in rural areas.  The domestic U.S. long distance market is competitive, 
although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for low volume customers.  
Competition in the international services markets is also increasing.  These markets are rapidly 
changing from being dominated by a small number of national telecommunications providers to 
having a large number of competitors.
Advantages
By relying primarily on general instructions to guide the preservation of records, Part 42 gives 
regulated common carriers significant flexibility in choosing how to preserve records.  This 
allows carriers to choose the storage media, reducing their record storage and retrieval costs.  Part 
42 also gives carriers flexibility in determining proper retention periods, although it specifies the 
retention period for toll records in order to assist law enforcement activities.  Part 42 also benefits 
consumers by ensuring that they have access to information on carrier rates, terms, and 
conditions.
Disadvantages
Part 42 may increase carriers' recordkeeping costs to some extent.  Requiring carriers to post 
information concerning their rates for domestic, interstate, interexchange services may increase 
the risk of tacit price collusion.
Recent Efforts
On March 31, 1999, the Commission reinstated the public disclosure requirement for domestic, 
interstate, interexchange long distance services in light of plans to implement de-tariffing of  these 
services.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently upheld the Commission's 
decision to mandate de-tariffing for domestic interstate long distance service.  
Recommendation
The staff recommends that Part 42 be maintained without substantial change because it provides 
carriers with significant flexibility while ensuring that necessary information will be available to 
the Commission and law enforcement officials.  The staff also recommends that the public 
disclosure rules in Part 42 be maintained because they provide valuable information to 
consumers.

PART 43 - REPORTS OF COMMUNICATIONS COMMON CARRIERS AND CERTAIN 
AFFILIATES
Description
Section 211 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires carriers to file with the 
Commission copies of all contracts, agreements, or arrangements with other carriers that relate to 
any traffic affected by the Act.   Section 219 authorizes the Commission to require all carriers 
that are subject to the Act to file annual reports with the Commission.   Section 220 allows the 
Commission to prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept 
by carriers. 
Part 43 of the Commission's rules implements these sections by establishing rules that perform 
three major functions.  First, Part 43 prescribes general requirements and filing procedures for 
several reports which various carriers are required to file.  These include the annual Automated 
Reporting Management Information System (ARMIS) reports on financial and operating data that 
are filed by common carriers with operating revenues exceeding an indexed revenue threshold, 
reports on proposed depreciation changes, reports on international telecommunications traffic, 
and international circuit status reports.  Second, Part 43 requires that certain carriers file with the 
Commission copies of specified contracts, agreements and arrangements with other carriers.  
Third, Part 43 sets forth the Commission's International Settlements Policy, which is designed to 
ensure that U.S. telecommunications carriers pay nondiscriminatory rates for termination of 
international traffic in foreign countries.
Purpose
Part 43 is intended to implement section 211.  The reports required by Part 43 assist the 
Commission in monitoring the industry to ensure that carriers comply with the Commission's 
rules, and in tracking market and other industry developments, which improves the Commission's 
ability to identify developing regulatory issues and analyze the effects of alternative policy 
choices.  The reports of proposed changes in depreciation rates allow the Commission to monitor 
the depreciation rates for dominant carriers' capital assets.   The contract-filing requirement 
helps the Commission to identify potential instances of anti-competitive conduct, and to enforce 
its International Settlements Policy.  The International Settlements Policy is designed to protect 
U.S. international carriers and the customers they serve from the potential exercise of market 
power by dominant foreign carriers, which could unilaterally set the prices, terms and conditions 
under which U.S. carriers are able to exchange international traffic.   
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitors 
still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition for business customers in 
metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than competition for residential 
customers or customers in rural areas.  The domestic U.S. long distance market is competitive, 
although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for low volume customers.  
Competition in the international services markets is also increasing.  These markets are rapidly 
changing from being dominated by a small number of national telecommunications providers to 
having a large number of competitors.
Advantages
The reports required by Part 43 increase the Commission's ability to ensure compliance with the 
Commission's rules.  They also provide the Commission, other government agencies, state 
regulators, industry, and the public with valuable information on market and other industry trends 
and developments.  This information is helpful to the Commission in identifying developing 
regulatory issues and evaluating the effects of policy choices.  The contract filing requirements 
also assist the Commission in identifying and remedying potential instances of anti-competitive 
conduct.  The International Settlements Policy and related requirements protect U.S. carriers and 
their customers from the potential exercise of market power by dominant foreign carriers.
Disadvantages
Some carriers allege that certain of the required filings are unduly burdensome.  Part 43 may also 
require the filing of some information that is unnecessarily detailed or no longer necessary in 
light of competitive developments. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission recently revised its ARMIS reporting requirements as part of its 1998 Biennial 
Regulatory Review process.   The Commission reduced reporting requirements for mid-sized 
carriers, and improved the definitions, descriptions and instructions used in preparing ARMIS 
reports.  The Commission adopted further streamlining measures in Phase 1 of the 
Comprehensive Review proceeding.   Currently, the staff is undertaking additional review of the 
ARMIS reports in Phase 2 of the Comprehensive Review proceeding intended to produce further 
streamlining. 
In 1999, the Commission adopted a sweeping reform of the longstanding international settlements 
policy, deregulating inter-carrier settlement arrangements between U.S. carriers and foreign non-
dominant carriers on competitive routes.   The Commission, among other things, eliminated the 
international settlements policy and contract filing requirements for arrangements with foreign 
carriers that lack market power, and eliminated the international settlements policy for 
arrangements with all carriers on routes with rates for terminating U.S. calls that are at least 25 
percent lower than the relevant settlement rate benchmark.
Recommendation
The staff recommends continuation of the ongoing efforts to streamline further the ARMIS 
reporting requirements.  The staff also recommends modifying or eliminating some of the rules 
governing reports to be filed by carriers providing international telecommunications services.  In 
particular, the staff recommends elimination of section 43.53 of the rules because the required 
reports regarding the division of international telegraph charges appear to be unnecessary now 
that telegraph service is no longer a major component of telecommunications traffic.  In addition, 
this reporting requirement duplicates requirements in other rules.  The staff also recommends that 
section 43.81 of the rules be removed from Part 43 since it is no longer in effect.
The staff also recommends that the Commission amend section 43.51 of the rules to simplify the 
language and to provide that copies of contracts for international services do not need to be filed 
with the Commission unless the contracts concern common carrier service between the U.S. and 
foreign points and involve a foreign carrier that has market power in that foreign market, or a 
U.S. carrier that has been classified as dominant on any routes included in the contract, for 
reasons other than a foreign carrier affiliation. 

PART 51 - INTERCONNECTION
Description
Sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, were adopted as part of 
the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  Most significantly, these provisions require that the 
incumbent local exchange carriers open their networks to competition, and are critical to fostering 
local exchange and exchange access competition as envisioned by Congress.  Section 251 
establishes distinct sets of pro-competitive requirements for telecommunications carriers, local 
exchange carriers, and incumbent local exchange carriers.  Section 251 specifically provides that 
all telecommunications carriers have a duty to interconnect with other telecommunications 
carriers, among other things.  Under section 251, local exchange carriers are subject to additional 
requirements concerning number portability, dialing parity, right-of-way access, and reciprocal 
compensation.  In addition to these obligations, incumbent local exchange carriers are subject to 
further requirements concerning negotiation of agreements, interconnection, access to unbundled 
network elements, resale, notification of changes, and collocation.   Section 251 also provides 
for pricing standards and standards for incumbent carrier pricing of services offered for resale.  
Section 252 establishes procedures for negotiating, arbitrating, and approving interconnection 
agreements.  The Part 51 rules implement these statutory requirements.
Part 51 is organized into nine lettered sub-parts:
A - General Information
B - Telecommunications Carriers
C - Obligations of All Local Exchange Carriers
D - Additional Obligations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers
E - Exemptions, Suspensions, and Modifications of Requirements of Section 251 of
       the Act
F - Pricing of Elements
G - Resale
H - Reciprocal Compensation for Transport and Termination of Local
       Telecommunications Traffic
I - Procedures for Implementation of Section 252 of the Act

Purpose
Part 51 implements the requirements found in sections 251 and 252.  Part 51 is intended to foster 
competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets by requiring that incumbent local 
exchange carriers open their networks to competition, and by establishing pricing standards 
applicable to the facilities and services that the incumbent local exchange carriers provide to their 
competitors.  Consistent with section 251 of the Act, Part 51 also contains certain pro-competitive 
requirements that apply to all telecommunications carriers and competitive local exchange 
carriers.
Analysis  
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.
Advantages
The Part 51 rules require incumbent local exchange carriers to open their networks to 
competition, and establish pricing standards.  This fosters competition in the local exchange and 
exchange access markets.  Competition in these markets will increase the choices available to 
consumers, as well as create incentives for increased efficiency and the more rapid deployment of 
new services and technology.  
Disadvantages 
The Part 51 rules impose some costs on incumbent local exchange carriers. 
Recent Efforts
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals recently overturned certain of the pricing rules in Part 51, 
and remanded them to the Commission for further consideration. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends continued monitoring of the development of local exchange and exchange 
access competition.  The staff also recommends that the Commission re-evaluate the various 
mechanisms for intercarrier compensation for traffic origination and termination.


PART 52 - NUMBERING
Description
Section 251(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, adopted as part of the 1996 
Telecommunications Act, governs the administration of telephone numbers.  It gives the 
Commission exclusive jurisdiction over those portions of the North American Numbering Plan 
that pertain to the United States.  Section 251(e) also requires the Commission to create or 
designate one or more impartial entities to administer telecommunications numbering and to 
make those numbers available on an equitable basis.  It also charges the Commission with 
establishing cost recovery mechanisms for numbering administration arrangements and number 
portability. 
Part 52 implements the requirements of section 251(e).  It contains rules governing the 
administration of the North American Numbering Plan, which is the basic numbering scheme for 
the telecommunications networks located in the United States, its territories, and other countries 
in North America.  Part 52 also contains rules designed to ensure that users of 
telecommunications services can retain, at their existing locations, their existing telephone 
numbers when they switch from one local exchange telecommunications carrier to another.  It 
also contains rules governing the administration of toll free telephone numbers.
Part 52 is organized into four lettered sub-parts:
A - Scope and Authority  
B - Administration
C - Number Portability
D - Toll Free Numbers

Purpose
Part 52 implements the requirements of section 251(e).  The purpose of the rules in Part 52 is to 
establish requirements to govern the administration and efficient use of telephone numbers within 
the United States for provision of telecommunications services. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The domestic U.S. long 
distance market is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers 
than for low volume customers. 
Advantages
The Part 52 rules benefit the public by fostering the efficient use of telephone numbers, which are 
a scarce national resource, and minimizing the potential for anti-competitive behavior.  They are 
designed to provide clear and predictable guidelines for the use of telephone numbers while 
minimizing administrative costs.  The number portability rules are also designed to remove 
barriers to local exchange competition and reduce the consumers' costs of switching to an 
alternative carrier by ensuring that customers can retain their local telephone number when they 
switch from one local carrier to another. 
Disadvantages
Carriers are required to fund the costs of administering the North American Numbering Plan. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission released a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 
March 2000 addressing how to meet the increased demand for telephone numbers in light of the 
declining quantity of available numbers.  The Report and Order adopted measures that will 
promote more efficient allocation and use of telephone numbers, and established policies to 
ensure that carriers have access to the numbering resources they need to participate in the 
competitive telecommunications marketplace.  
The Commission also released a Report and Order in July 2000 addressing whether the current 
method of administering toll free numbers should be replaced by a management system more 
suitable to a competitive environment.  The North American Numbering Council will prepare a 
report to the Commission on this issue within the next six months.
Recommendation
The staff recommends the retention of Part 52 and the continuation of current efforts to optimize 
the use of numbering resources in an impartial, economically efficient manner.


PART 53 - SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING BELL OPERATING COMPANIES
Description 
Section 272 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, establishes safeguards applicable 
to Bell Operating Company (BOC) equipment manufacturing, provision of in-region interLATA 
toll service, and provision of interLATA information services (other than electronic publishing 
and alarm monitoring).   The Commission's Part 53 rules implement these requirements.  In 
particular, the Part 53 rules provide that the BOCs must use a separate affiliate for certain 
activities, and set out structural separation, transactional, and auditing requirements.  The Part 53 
rules also contain provisions adopted pursuant to section 271 of the Act concerning joint 
marketing of local exchange and long distance services.

Part 53 is organized into six lettered subparts (three of which are reserved for future use):
	A - General Information
	B - Bell Operating Company Entry into InterLATA Services
	C - Separate Affiliate; Safeguards
	D - Manufacturing by Bell Operating Companies [reserved]
	E - Electronic Publishing by Bell Operating Companies [reserved]
	F - Alarm Monitoring Services [reserved]

Purpose
Part 53 generally implements the structural safeguards mandated in section 272.  These separate 
subsidiary and auditing requirements are designed to prevent the BOCs from using their 
dominance in the market for local exchange and exchange access services to compete unfairly in 
the related markets.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume business and 
residential customers than for low volume customers.
Advantages
Part 53 reduces the potential for the BOCs to engage in anticompetitive behavior by leveraging 
their dominance in the market for local exchange and exchange access services to compete 
unfairly in the markets for other goods and services. 
Disadvantages
Use of a structurally separate subsidiary for certain activities and compliance with the auditing 
requirements in Part 53 increase carrier costs.
Recent Efforts
Not applicable.
Recommendation
The staff recommends only minor changes to Part 53 at this time.  In this regard, we note that 
much of Part 53 is statutorily mandated, including the basic requirement for the use of separate 
subsidiaries for certain activities and most of the structural separation and auditing requirements.  
Section 53.101 of the rules concerning joint marketing has sunset and should be deleted from Part 
53.  The section 272 provisions requiring a separate subsidiary for the provision of interLATA 
information services have also sunset, and the rules related to this requirement should be deleted 
from Part 53. 


PART 54 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE
Description
Sections 214(e) and 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 direct the Commission to establish 
specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.   
Part 54 implements these provisions of the Act.  Part 54 contains rules governing the operation of 
the Commission's four basic universal service programs: (1) the high-cost support mechanism, 
which provides support to keep rates affordable in high-cost areas; (2) the low-income support 
mechanism, which provides support to keep rates affordable for low-income consumers; (3) the 
schools and libraries support mechanism, which provides support for telecommunications and 
Internet access and internal connections for eligible schools and libraries; and (4) the rural health 
care support mechanism, which provides support for telecommunications services for eligible 
rural health care providers.  In addition, Part 54 contains administrative rules governing the 
collection of universal service contributions and the distribution of support, as well as provisions 
for the creation of the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to administer the 
universal service support mechanisms.  
Part 54 is organized into ten lettered sub-parts:
	A - General Information
	B - Services Designated for Support
	C - Carriers Eligible for Universal Service Support
	D - Universal Service Support for High Cost Areas
	E - Universal Service Support for Low-Income Consumers
	F - Universal Service Support for Schools and Libraries
	G - Universal Service Support for Health Care Providers
	H - Administration
	I - Review of Decisions Issued by the Administrator
	J - Interstate Access Universal Service Support Mechanism

Purpose
Part 54 implements the requirements found in section 214(e) and 254.  Part 54 is designed to 
promote universal service by ensuring that all consumers, including consumers living in rural, 
insular, and high-cost areas as well as low-income consumers, have access to affordable 
telecommunications services.  It is also designed to ensure that schools, libraries, rural health care 
providers, and the members of the public that they serve, have access to affordable 
telecommunications and information services.  Part 54 is designed to accomplish these goals in a 
competitively neutral manner by collecting support from every telecommunications carrier that 
provides interstate telecommunications service, and by making support available on a 
technologically neutral basis to any eligible service provider.  This is intended to encourage the 
provision of service by wireless and other emerging technologies that have not been eligible to 
receive universal service support in the past, but may prove to be efficient alternatives to 
traditional wireline service in high-cost and rural areas.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.
Advantages
Part 54 serves the public interest by establishing explicit universal service mechanisms to ensure 
that all consumers have access to affordable telecommunications services.  It also promotes 
competition by making explicit universal service support available to any eligible 
telecommunications carrier in a competitively and technologically neutral manner.  This also 
encourages efficient entry in high-cost areas.  Finally, Part 54 benefits the public by making 
telecommunications and information services available to qualifying schools, libraries, and rural 
health care providers at reduced rates.
Disadvantages
The reporting requirements necessary for the collection, calculation, and disbursement of 
universal service support may place administrative burdens on certain carriers.  The current 
procedures for review of USAC's funding decisions concerning schools, libraries, and rural 
health care providers may also place unnecessary administrative burdens on the Commission. 
Recent Efforts
Many of the Part 54 rules were adopted in 1997, and they have been revised a number of times 
since.   On June 30, 2000, the Commission released an order to promote telecommunications 
subscribership by those living on tribal lands.   
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend any major new initiatives concerning the Commission's universal 
service rules as part of the 2000 Biennial Regulatory Review.  The staff, however, recommends 
that the Commission consider modifying Part 54 to streamline the process for appeals of USAC 
funding decisions by requiring applicants to file appeals with USAC in the first instance unless 
the appeals raise new or novel questions of fact, law, or policy.   The staff also recommends 
certain minor revisions to the Part 54 rules to remove transitional provisions that are no longer 
applicable.  For example, section 54.701(b)-(e), concerning the now-completed merger of the 
Schools & Libraries Corporation and the Rural Health Care Corporation into the Universal 
Service Administrative Company, should be deleted.

PART 59 - INFRASTRUCTURE SHARING
Description
Section 259 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Commission to 
prescribe regulations that require incumbent LECs to make available to qualifying carriers certain 
public switched network infrastructure, technology, information, and telecommunications 
facilities and functions used to provide telecommunications services, or access to information 
services.  Part 59 implements section 259 of the Act, by specifying the general duty of incumbent 
LECs to share such infrastructure with qualifying carriers (i.e., carriers that fulfill universal 
service obligations) and setting out general terms and conditions for such sharing.  Part 59 applies 
only when the qualifying carrier does not seek to use the shared infrastructure to offer certain 
services within the incumbent LEC's telephone exchange area.
Purpose
Part 59 is designed to implement the requirements of section 259.  Part 59 is intended to foster the 
provision of advanced telecommunications and information services by small carriers.  It is 
intended to accomplish this by allowing qualifying carriers to take advantage of the economies of 
scale and scope possessed by larger incumbent LECs.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.
Advantages
Part 59 fosters the availability of advanced telecommunications and information services by 
articulating general rules and guidelines to define the obligations imposed by section 259 and by 
relying in large part on negotiations between interested parties.  This negotiation-driven approach 
allows the parties to craft section 259 agreements that best meet their needs with minimal 
regulatory supervision.
Disadvantages
The rules implementing section 259 may impose costs on incumbent LECs that must share 
infrastructure with qualifying carriers.  Part 59 minimizes these costs by relying on private 
negotiations to establish the precise terms for infrastructure sharing. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission recently reaffirmed its negotiation-based approach to implementing section 
259. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the negotiation-driven, minimally-regulatory approach adopted in Part 
59 be maintained and that no substantial changes be made to this Part.  During the three years 
since Part 59 was adopted, no evidence has been presented to the Commission indicating that 
parties have been unable to negotiate section 259 infrastructure sharing agreements.

PART 61 - TARIFFS
Description
Sections 203 and 204 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, establish tariff filing 
requirements applicable to common carriers.   Sections 201 and 202 require rates, terms and 
conditions to be "just and reasonable,"  and prohibit "unjust or unreasonable discrimination."   
Part 61 implements these sections of the Act by establishing rules that perform two major 
functions.  First, the Part 61 rules establish requirements governing the filing, form, content, 
public notice periods, and accompanying support materials for tariffs.  Second, Part 61 sets forth 
the pricing rules and related requirements that apply to incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) 
that are subject to price cap regulation.
Part 61 is organized into ten lettered sub-parts:

	A - General
	B - Rules for Electronic Filing
C - General Rules for Nondominant Carriers
D - General Tariff Rules for International Dominant Carriers
E - General Rules for Dominant Carriers
F - Specific Rules for Tariff Publications of Dominant and Nondominant Carriers
G - Concurrences
H - Applications for Special Permission
I - Adoption of Tariffs and Other Documents of Predecessor Carriers
J - Suspensions

Purpose
Part 61 is intended to implement sections 203 and 204.  The Part 61 tariffing rules are designed to 
provide consumers with information on the rates, terms and conditions for telecommunications 
services.  They are also intended to ensure that the carriers provide the Commission and the 
public with information necessary for evaluating the lawfulness of tariff rates, terms and 
conditions.  The price cap rules in Part 61 are designed to ensure that the rates of price cap 
carriers are "just and reasonable" and "not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory."  At the same 
time, the price cap rules, in conjunction with the Part 69 access charge rules, are designed to 
create incentives for increased carrier efficiency, to streamline the tariff review process, and to 
allow the carriers some degree of pricing flexibility.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitors 
still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition for business customers in 
metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than competition for residential 
customers or customers in rural areas.  The domestic U.S. long distance market is competitive, 
although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for low volume customers.  
Competition in the international services markets is also increasing.  These markets are rapidly 
changing from being dominated by a small number of national telecommunications providers to 
having a large number of competitors.
Advantages
The Part 61 tariffing rules benefit the public by providing information on the rates, terms, and 
conditions for telecommunications services.  In addition, the requirements for support materials 
facilitate review of the lawfulness of the tariffs.  The requirements for support materials thus 
reduce the cost of enforcing Commission pricing rules, and permit interested parties to challenge 
tariff provisions.
The price cap rules contained in Part 61 protect customers by capping the rates charged by the 
LECs and limiting the potential for LECs to exercise market power in an anticompetitive manner.  
They also foster carrier efficiency, streamline the tariff process, and allow the carriers some 
degree of pricing flexibility. 
Disadvantages
The tariff filing requirements may impede competition by reducing carrier flexibility and 
potentially foster oligopoly pricing by requiring the public disclosure of rates, terms, and 
conditions.  Furthermore, the requirement for tariff support materials imposes some preparation 
costs on the carriers.  Over time, the price cap rules may reduce economic efficiency by limiting 
carrier pricing flexibility. 
Recent Efforts
As part of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review process, the Commission conducted a 
comprehensive review of Part 61, and eliminated a number of rules that were no longer 
necessary.   More recently, the Commission also addressed the price cap rules in a 
comprehensive manner in the CALLS proceeding.   In addition, the Commission is in the 
process of implementing mandatory de-tariffing for domestic interexchange toll service,  and is 
considering doing the same for competitive local exchange carrier services.  
Recommendation
At this time, the staff generally recommends retaining the existing Part 61 requirements, with 
continued monitoring of competitive developments to permit changes as warranted by increased 
competition.  The staff recommends, however, that the Commission extend mandatory de-
tariffing to the international services of non-dominant interexchange carriers, including 
Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers and U.S. carriers classified as dominant solely due 
to foreign affiliations.  We also note that the inter-carrier compensation proceeding recommended 
elsewhere in this report could result in some revisions to Part 61.

PART 63 - EXTENSION OF LINES, NEW LINES, AND DISCONTINUANCE, REDUCTION, 
OUTAGE AND IMPAIRMENT OF SERVICE BY COMMON CARRIERS; AND GRANTS OF 
RECOGNIZED PRIVATE OPERATING AGENCY STATUS
Description
Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, provides that no carrier shall 
undertake the construction of a new line or extension of any line, or shall acquire or operate any 
line, or extension thereof, without first having obtained a certificate from the Commission that the 
present or future public convenience and necessity require the construction and/or operation of 
such extended line.  Section 214 also provides that no carrier shall discontinue, reduce or impair 
service to a community without first having obtained a certificate from the Commission that 
neither the present nor future public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected by such 
action.   Part 63 of our rules sets forth specific information that must be included in a section 
214 application for market entry or exit by a common carrier. 
Part 63 is organized into five sub-designations:
	Extensions and Supplements ( 63.01-63.25)
	General Provisions Relating to All Applications Under Section 214 ( 63.50-63.53)
	Discontinuance, Reduction, Outage and Impairment ( 63.60-63.100)
	Contents of Applications; Examples ( 63.500-63.601)
	Request for Designation as a Recognized Private Operating Agency ( 63.701-63.702)
	
Purpose
Part 63 sets out the requirements for obtaining a section 214 authorization to provide or 
discontinue service.  A section 214 application is a request for authority to provide or to 
discontinue services pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act.  A carrier must receive 
a section 214 authorization prior to initiating or discontinuing service. 
The primary purpose in adopting entry criteria under section 214 is to promote effective 
competition in the U.S. telecommunications services market.  With regard to the construction of 
facilities, Commission authorization is needed to protect consumers from being charged by 
carriers for unneeded facilities.  Commission authorization for discontinuance of service protects 
consumers from loss of service.  Domestic markets have become sufficiently competitive that the 
Commission has substantially deregulated the procedures for obtaining section 214 
authorizations.  For international telecommunications services, the section 214 authorization 
requirement serves several purposes.  It enables the Commission to screen applications for risks 
to competition and to deny or condition authorizations as appropriate.  The review process also 
includes consultation with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, 
foreign policy, and trade concerns that may be unique to the provision of international services.  
The section 214 authorization requirement also helps us monitor competitive conditions along 
U.S. international routes as well as each carrier's compliance with our rules and policies 
governing the provision of international services, and it also serves to inform small carriers of 
their special obligations as providers of international service.
Part 63 also contains rules to protect U.S. consumers and carriers from foreign 
telecommunications carriers exerting market power in the U.S. telecommunications market.  For 
example, the No Special Concessions rule prohibits U.S. international carriers from agreeing to 
accept special concessions directly or indirectly from any foreign carrier with respect to any U.S. 
international route where the foreign carrier possesses sufficient market power on the foreign end 
of the route to affect competition adversely in the U.S. market.   Part 63 also contains 
procedures for a party to be designated as a Recognized Private Operating Agency. 	
Analysis
Status of Competition
There is a significant amount of competition in the provision of domestic long distance services.  
Competition for local exchange services is increasing.  Competition in international services is 
also increasing, and the market is rapidly changing from a system that used to be dominated by a 
small number of national telecommunications providers (generally the incumbent national 
monopoly telephone companies)  to a system with large numbers of new entrants and 
competitors.
Advantages
Part 63 provides carriers and the public with procedures to be followed to obtain authorization to 
construct facilities, provide service, and discontinue service.  The rules provide certainty 
regarding what information must be filed with the Commission, how long action on the 
application will take, the types of services that can be provided over the facilities, and in what 
circumstances a carrier may discontinue service.
Disadvantages
The rules can be administratively burdensome on the carriers and the Commission.  Some of the 
rules are duplicative, and some are unclear.  The requirement for Commission authorization may 
also delay the introduction of new services to the public.
Recent Efforts
The increasing number of common carriers providing service and the resulting growth of 
competition have allowed the Commission to reduce the administrative burdens placed on carriers 
regarding market entry and exit.  In 1999, the Commission amended the rules in Part 63 to de-
regulate market entry and streamline market exit filing requirements, under section 214, for 
domestic carriers.   The new rules confer "blanket" section 214 certification for new lines of all 
domestic carriers, exempt line extensions and video programming services from section 214 
requirements, and provide that all section 214 applications to discontinue domestic service will be 
automatically granted unless the Commission notifies the applicant otherwise.  As a result of this 
deregulation, the only section 214 applications the Commission receives for domestic service are 
for market exit, under which a carrier must get discontinuance authority and notify customers 
when it stops providing service to a community.  Market entry for domestic services is self-
executing, and no applications are needed. 
Regarding section 214 authorizations for international telecommunications services, in 1996 the 
Commission created global section 214 authorizations, reduced paperwork obligations, 
streamlined tariff requirements for non-dominant international carriers, and ensured that essential 
information is readily available to all carriers and users.    In 1999, the Commission further 
streamlined its procedures for granting international section 214 authorizations so that now 
approximately 99 percent of international section 214 applications filed qualify for streamlined 
processing.  As a result, most new carriers are authorized to provide international services on 
most international routes 14 days after public notice of an application.  Carriers already providing 
service are able to complete pro forma transactions and assignments of their authorizations 
without prior Commission approval and to provide service through their wholly owned 
subsidiaries without separate Commission approval.  Carriers under common ownership with an 
already-authorized carrier are able to provide the same authorized services after only a minimal 
waiting period.   
Recommendation
The staff recommends that certain sections of Part 63 be amended or deleted, but that most of the 
existing sections be retained at this time.  We recommend that the sections which were amended 
in 1999 to lower entry barriers for domestic carriers be retained because they minimize 
transaction costs, streamline the applications process, promote competition, and increase 
consumer choice.  The sections related to the form of applications to be filed (i.e., amendments, 
additional information, copies, fees, filing periods, and form (such as paper size)) should be 
retained because administratively they provide clear and predictable rules.  We find, on the other 
hand, that the rules describing and defining the types of discontinuance of services for which 
section 214 authorization must be obtained are largely obsolete, and are duplicative, and thus 
recommend that they be considered for modification and consolidation.  The staff has also 
identified several duplicative rules that should be considered for elimination, and a number of 
rules that are unclear, ambiguous or contain errors that the staff recommends be clarified or 
corrected.

PART 64 - MISCELLANEOUS RULES RELATING TO COMMON CARRIERS, SUBPART A - 
TRAFFIC DAMAGE CLAIMS
Description 
Subpart A requires carriers engaged in radio-telegraph, wire-telegraph, or ocean-cable service to 
maintain separate files for each damage claim of a traffic nature filed with the carrier.  Subpart A 
also prohibits such carriers from making payments as a result of any traffic damage claim in 
excess of the total amount collected for the message or messages from which the claim arose 
unless the claim is presented in writing and sets forth the reason for the claim.  These rules are 
based on the Commission's authority pursuant to sections 1, 4, 201-205, and 220 of the 
Communications Act, as amended. 
Purpose
Subpart A requires that certain types of carriers maintain records concerning damage claims, and 
limits damage payments absent a written claim.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Telegraph service, which appears to be the primary focus of this subpart, is no longer a major 
service offering.
Advantages
Ensures that certain carriers maintain records concerning damage claims.
Disadvantages
Subpart A appears to focus on the provision of telegraph service, which is no longer a major 
service offering.
Recent Efforts
No recent action.
Recommendation
The staff recommends the Commission consider removing subpart A since it appears to be 
outdated.

PART 64, SUBPART B - RESTRICTIONS ON INDECENT TELEPHONE MESSAGE SERVICES
Description  
Section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits use of the telephone 
for the purpose of obscene commercial communications.  It also prohibits use of the telephone for 
indecent commercial communications without the consent of the other party and prohibits use of 
the telephone for indecent commercial communications which are available to anyone under 18 
years of age.   Section 223(b) also provides for certain defenses to prosecution for making 
indecent commercial communications. 
Subpart B implements the provisions of section 223(b) relating to defenses to prosecution for 
indecent commercial communications.  Under section 64.201, a provider of indecent commercial 
telephone communications has a defense to prosecution if the provider has notified the common 
carrier that the provider is engaged in providing indecent commercial communications, and does 
one of the following: (1) requires credit card payment before transmitting the message; (2) 
requires an authorized access or identification code, which has been established by mail, before 
transmitting the message; or (3) scrambles the message so that the audio is unintelligible and 
incomprehensible without a descrambler.  Subpart B also provides a defense to prosecution for 
message sponsor subscribers to mass announcement services if they ask the carrier to take certain 
precautions.  In addition, subpart B bars common carriers, to the extent technically feasible, from 
providing access to obscene or indecent communications from the telephone of anyone who has 
not previously requested access to such services in writing if the carrier provides billing and 
collection for the provider of the obscene or indecent communications.  
Purpose 
Subpart B is intended to implement the statutory restrictions on the commercial provision by 
telephone of indecent communications, consistent with the First Amendment.  In particular, 
subpart B is intended to protect minors and non-consenting adults from indecent communications.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not relevant.
Advantages
Subpart B protects minors and non-consenting adults from indecent commercial telephone 
communications within a framework designed to be consistent with the First Amendment. 
Disadvantages
Restrictions affecting speech are subject to potential challenge as inconsistent with the First 
Amendment. 
Recent Efforts
No recent developments.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend changes to subpart B as part of the 2000 Biennial Review. 

PART 64, SUBPART C - FURNISHING OF FACILITIES TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
Description
Subpart C, consisting of section 64.301 of the Commission's rules, requires U.S. common carriers 
to provide services and facilities for communications to any foreign government, upon reasonable 
request.  If a foreign government refuses to provide services or facilities for communications to 
the U.S. Government, U.S. carriers, to the extent specifically ordered by the Commission, shall 
deny equivalent services or facilities to the foreign government.   This rule was adopted 
pursuant to the Commission's authority under sections 201, 214, 303, and 308 of the 
Communications Act, as amended. 
Purpose
Section 64.301 is intended to ensure that the U.S. Government has access to communications 
services overseas.  It permits the Commission to order U.S. carriers to deny foreign governments 
access to communications services in the United States if the foreign government has denied the 
U.S. government access to communications services or facilities overseas.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the international services markets is increasing.  These markets are rapidly 
changing from being dominated by a small number of national telecommunications providers to 
having a large number of competitors.
Advantages
The rule helps to ensure that the U.S. Government has access to communications services and 
facilities overseas.
Disadvantages
The Commission rarely exercises this authority. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission last revised this rule in 1963, and would need to consult with the State 
Department before doing so again. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends retaining the rule at this time.

PART 64, SUBPART D - PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING PRIORITY SERVICES IN 
EMERGENCIES
Description 
Subpart D requires that common carriers maintain, provision, and, if disrupted, restore facilities 
and services in accordance with the policies and procedures in Appendix A to Part 64.  Appendix 
A establishes policies and procedures and assigns responsibilities for the National Security 
Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System.  These 
requirements are based on the Commission's authority under sections 1, 201-05 of the 
Communications Act as amended. 
Purpose
Subpart D is designed to ensure that critical communications services are available during times 
of national emergency.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not Relevant.
Advantages
Subpart D promotes public safety and national security by establishing clear procedures and 
criteria for ensuring that critical communications services are available in times of national 
emergency. 
Disadvantages
Complying with these requirements may impose administrative costs on carriers.
Recent Effort
There have not been any recent actions.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend changes in subpart D.

PART 64, SUBPART E - USE OF RECORDING DEVICES BY TELEPHONE COMPANIES
Description 
Subpart E governs the use of recording devices by telephone common carriers to record interstate 
or foreign telephone conversations between members of the public and telephone company agents 
or employees.  Subpart E requires that telephone companies wishing to record such conversations 
must: (1) obtain the prior consent of all parties; (2) give a verbal notification prior to recording; 
and (3) accompany the use of the recording device with an automatic tone warning device that 
produces a distinct signal at regular intervals.  These requirements are based on the Commission's 
authority under sections 1, 2, 4, 201, and 205 of the Communications Act as amended. 
Purpose
Subpart E is intended to protect privacy interests.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not relevant.
Advantages
Subpart E is designed to protect privacy.
Disadvantages
Subpart E appears to duplicate federal and state electronic privacy statutes, including 18 U.S.C.  
2510 et seq., and 47 U.S.C. 1004.  It also references outdated technology.     
Recent Effort
There have not been any recent changes.
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission consider removal of subpart E.

PART 64, SUBPART F - TELECOMMUNICATIONS RELAY SERVICES AND RELATED 
CUSTOMER PREMISES EQUIPMENT FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Description 
Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), codified as section 225 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Commission to ensure that 
telecommunications relay service (TRS) is available, "to the extent possible and in the most 
efficient manner," to individuals with hearing or speech disabilities in the United States.   
Section 225 defines TRS as telephone transmission services that make it possible for an 
individual with a hearing or speech disability to engage in communication by wire or radio with a 
hearing individual in a manner functionally equivalent to someone without such a disability. 
Part 64, subpart F was adopted to implement section 225 of the Act.  The rules provide minimum 
functional, operational, and technical standards for TRS programs. The rules also establish a cost 
recovery and a carrier contribution mechanism for the provision of interstate TRS and require 
states to establish cost recovery mechanisms for the provision of intrastate TRS. 
The rules give states a strong role in ensuring the availability of TRS by treating carriers as in 
compliance with their statutory obligations if they operate in a state that has a relay program 
certified as compliant by this Commission pursuant to rules in subpart F.
Purpose
Subpart F is designed to implement section 225.  Subpart F is intended to facilitate 
communication by persons with a hearing or speech disability by ensuring that interstate and 
intrastate TRS is available throughout the country, and by ensuring uniform minimum quality 
standards for such relay services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
There is competition in the interstate TRS market, but very little competition in the intrastate TRS 
market. 
Advantages
The Commission's TRS rules ensure that individuals with hearing or speech disabilities receive 
the same quality of service when they make relay calls, regardless of where their call originates or 
terminates.  The rules also ensure that the telecommunications service they receive is 
"functionally equivalent" to that available to persons who do not have such disabilities.  The rules 
are particularly important to ensure service quality because there is so little intrastate competition 
among intrastate TRS providers.
Disadvantages
Technology is changing rapidly, and the regulations require relatively frequent modification to 
ensure functional equivalence to voice telephone service.  For instance, in March 2000, the 
Commission adopted rules modifying Part 64, subpart F to address the provision of new types of 
relay services. 
Recent Efforts
In March 2000, the Commission revised subpart F to, among other things: (1) modify the 
definition of telecommunications relay services to include speech-to-speech (STS) relay services 
(which provide a telecommunications link for persons with speech disabilities), video relay 
interpreting (VRI), (which facilitates telecommunications for individuals who use sign language), 
and non-English language relay services; (2) require that all relay services, whether mandatory or 
voluntary, funded by intrastate and interstate TRS funds, comply with minimum service quality 
standards; (3) require provision of STS relay services and permit reimbursement for the voluntary 
provision of VRI service; (4) modify the minimum service quality standards to better ensure 
functional equivalency; (5) clarify that the existing rules require outreach to all callers and for all 
forms of TRS; and (6) improve the Commission's process for handling TRS complaints. 
In August 2000, the Commission revised subpart F to require all carriers providing telephone 
voice transmission service to provide access via the 711 dialing code to all relay services as a toll 
free call. 
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend modification of subpart F as part of the 2000 Biennial Review.

PART 64, SUBPART G - FURNISHING OF ENHANCED SERVICES AND CUSTOMER 
PREMISES EQUIPMENT BY BELL OPERATING COMPANIES; TELEPHONE OPERATOR 
SERVICES
Description 
Subpart G addresses two distinct sets of issues.  First, it contains rules concerning the provision of 
enhanced services and customer premises equipment (CPE) by Bell Operating Companies.  
Second, it contains rules governing the provision of operator services.  These rules were adopted 
pursuant to the Commission's authority under sections 4, 201-205, 403, and 404 of the Act, as 
amended. 
The Bell Operating Companies may provide enhanced services and CPE pursuant to nonstructural 
safeguards established in the Computer III  (enhanced services) and Furnishing of CPE   
proceedings, or through a separate subsidiary as provided in section 64.702 of the Commission's 
rules.  If a Bell Operating Company provides enhanced services or CPE through a separate 
subsidiary, the separate subsidiary must: (1) obtain all transmission facilities necessary for the 
provision of enhanced services pursuant to tariff; (2) operate independently, with its own books 
of accounts, separate officers, personnel, and computer facilities; (3) deal with any affiliated 
manufacturing entity on an arm's length basis; and (4) compensate the Bell Operating Company 
for any research or development performed for the subsidiary.  Section 64.702 requires that 
transactions between the subsidiary and the parent or any other affiliate be put in writing, and 
bars Bell Operating Companies from engaging in marketing or sales on behalf of a CPE or 
enhanced services subsidiary.  The Bell Operating Company must also obtain Commission 
approval of the capitalization plans for any such separate subsidiary.  In addition, section 64.702 
bars all common carriers from providing CPE in conjunction with common carrier 
communications services. 
The remainder of subpart G addresses the provision of telephone operator services, and certain 
activities by call aggregators.   These rules require that operator service providers identify 
themselves at the beginning of each call and provide consumers with information concerning 
their rates.  The rules also prohibit call blocking and require that customers be able to obtain 
access to the operator services provider of their choice.  In addition, subpart G contains 
restrictions on charges related to the provision of operator services, minimum standards for 
routing and handling of emergency telephone calls, and rules governing the filing of 
informational tariffs and the provision of operator services for prison inmates
Purpose
Subpart G establishes safeguards for the provision of enhanced services and CPE by Bell 
Operating Companies.  These measures are intended to prevent the Bell Operating Companies 
from using their power in the local exchange market to adversely affect competition in other 
adjacent markets.
The subpart G rules governing the provision of operator services protect consumers by ensuring 
that they have access to useful information about the rates charged by operator service providers, 
and that they are able to reach the operator service provider of their choice.  The rules also 
promote public safety by prescribing minimum standards for operator service provider and call 
aggregator handling of emergency telephone calls.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The markets for both enhanced services and CPE are competitive.  The operator services market 
is becoming increasingly competitive, although consumers may not benefit fully from this 
competition due to a lack of consumer awareness about the choices available to them, especially 
when using payphones.
Advantages
Subpart G is designed to foster competition by preventing the Bell Operating Companies from 
using their power in the local exchange market to adversely affect competition in the provision of 
enhanced services and CPE.  The provisions of subpart G concerning operator services are 
designed to protect consumers from excessive charges for such services and ensure that 
consumers are able to reach the interexchange carrier of their choice. 
Disadvantages
The separate subsidiary requirements impose additional costs on the Bell Operating Companies.  
The rules concerning operator services impose some administrative costs on aggregators and 
operator service providers.
Recent Efforts
As part of its 1998 Biennial Review, the Commission is considering eliminating section 
64.702(c), which prohibits common carriers from bundling CPE with regulated communications 
services.  The Commission tentatively concluded that the CPE market is sufficiently competitive 
to justify eliminating this restriction.  
The Commission adopted amendments to the subpart G rules governing operator service 
providers on July 12, 1999.  These rule changes require that aggregators update the consumer 
information they must post on or near public telephones as soon as possible, but no later than 30 
days after the aggregator changes the pre-subscribed operator service provider. 
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend further changes in subpart G as part of the 2000 Biennial Review. 

PART 64, SUBPART H - EXTENSION OF UNSECURED CREDIT FOR INTERSTATE AND 
FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO CANDIDATES FOR FEDERAL OFFICE
Description
Part 64 subpart H, implements section 401 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 which 
requires the Commission to promulgate rules governing the extension of unsecured credit for 
foreign or interstate communications services to candidates for Federal office.   Part 64, subpart 
H requires certain carriers  to file periodic reports with the Commission detailing the terms of 
any unsecured credit extended by the carrier to, or on behalf of, a candidate for federal office.  In 
addition, subpart H requires carriers to extend unsecured credit on substantially equal terms to all 
candidates and other persons on behalf of any candidate for the same office. 
Purpose
The purpose of subpart H is to assist the Commission in monitoring unsecured credit 
arrangements between carriers and candidates for federal office, pursuant to the Federal Election 
Campaign Act.  It is also intended to ensure that such agreements are extended on substantially 
equal terms to all candidates for the same office.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange access market is growing, although competitors still serve only 
a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition for business customers in metropolitan 
areas has, in general, developed much more rapidly than competition for residential customers or 
customers in rural areas.  The U.S. market for domestic long distance service is competitive, 
although there is greater competition for higher volume business and residential customers than 
for low volume customers. 
Advantages
The subpart H reporting requirements and limited disclosure rules provide an efficient means of 
monitoring unsecured credit arrangements between carriers and candidates for federal office.  The 
rules also are designed to ensure that carriers do not favor any one candidate with regard to 
unsecured credit arrangements.
Disadvantages
These rules involve some additional administrative burdens for carriers.
Recent Efforts
There have been no significant changes in recent years.
Recommendation
The staff recommends the Commission retain subpart H.

PART 64, SUBPART I - ALLOCATION OF COSTS 
Description
Section 254(k) of the Communications Act, as amended, requires the Commission, with respect 
to interstate services, to establish any necessary cost allocation rules, accounting safeguards, and 
guidelines to ensure that services included within the definition of universal service bear no more 
than a reasonable allocation of joint and common costs of facilities used to provide these services.  
The requirements in subpart I are also based on the Commission's authority under sections 201 
and 220 of the Communications Act, as amended.   Subpart I of the Commission's rules 
prescribes procedures for the allocation of carriers' costs between regulated and non-regulated 
services.  It provides that all incumbent LECs required to separate regulated and non-regulated 
costs  shall use the attributable cost method of cost allocation and lists a number of cost 
allocation principles that such carriers must follow.  Subpart I provides that all carriers required to 
allocate costs between regulated and non-regulated activities are also subject to the affiliate 
transactions rules.  Subpart I also requires that all incumbent LECs with annual operating 
revenues at or above a specified indexed level (currently $114 million) file cost allocation 
manuals (CAMs) with the Commission.  Finally, subpart I provides that all carriers required to 
file CAMs must also engage independent auditors to audit their compliance with the 
Commission's cost allocation requirements.
Purpose
The subpart I rules are designed to implement section 254(k) and are intended to foster 
competition and protect consumers by preventing cross-subsidization between regulated and non-
regulated services provided by carriers subject to the cost allocation requirement. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.
Advantages
The subpart I rules protect consumers by helping to ensure that carriers' less competitive 
regulated services do not subsidize competitive ventures.  This also helps to prevent carriers from 
competing unfairly in other markets.  
Disadvantages
The cost allocation and affiliate transaction rules impose administrative costs on carriers subject 
to these requirements. 
Recent Efforts
Subpart I has been amended within the past few years to eliminate pre-filing requirements for 
CAM cost apportionment and time reporting changes, and to reduce the auditing requirements for 
mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers..   The Common Carrier Bureau has held 
workshops to discuss, among other things, proposals for additional changes to CAM requirements 
for mid-size carriers. 
Recommendation  
The staff recommends that the Commission consider additional changes to CAM requirements in 
Phase II of the Comprehensive Accounting Review proceeding.

PART 64, SUBPART J - INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS POLICY AND MODIFICATION 
REQUESTS
Description
subpart J requires that carriers request Commission approval for changes in the accounting rates 
for international telecommunications services unless the route involved is exempt from the 
Commission's International Settlements Policy (ISP).   The ISP requires that U.S. 
telecommunications carriers pay nondiscriminatory rates for termination of international traffic in 
foreign countries.   subpart J also sets forth the information which must be contained in a 
modification request and the procedures that govern Commission consideration of such 
requests.   These requirements are based on the Commission's authority pursuant to sections 1, 
201, 202, 203, and 309 of the Communications Act, as amended.  
Purpose
The requirement for filing accounting rate modification requests set out in Subpart J is intended 
to prevent the exercise of market power by foreign carriers.  In particular, it assists the 
Commission in ensuring compliance with the ISP and the Commission's Benchmarks Policy.   
The ISP was adopted as a result of the Commission's concern that a foreign carrier with market 
power would have the ability to "whipsaw" competing U.S. international carriers by 
discriminating among them, and /or by unilaterally setting the prices, terms, and conditions under 
which U.S. carriers are able to exchange traffic.   Such actions by foreign carriers would prevent 
U.S. carriers from obtaining lower accounting rates that would benefit U.S. consumers. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the international services markets is increasing.  These markets are rapidly 
changing from being dominated by a small number of national telecommunications providers to 
having a large number of competitors.
Advantages
Subpart J is designed to prevent the exercise of market power by foreign carriers, and facilitate 
the negotiation of lower accounting rates by U.S. international carriers to the benefit of American 
consumers. 
Disadvantages
The subpart J requirements may be too restrictive or over-broad.
Recent Efforts
The Commission reviewed its International Settlements Policy as part of its 1998 biennial 
review.   In that proceeding, the Commission made several changes to the ISP, deregulating 
inter-carrier settlement arrangements between U.S. carriers and foreign non-dominant carriers on 
competitive routes.  The Commission, among other things, eliminated the international 
settlements policy and contract filing requirements for arrangements with foreign carriers that 
lack market power, and eliminated the international settlements policy for arrangements with all 
carriers on routes where rates to terminate U.S. calls are at least 25 percent lower than the 
relevant settlement rate benchmark.  The Commission also adopted procedural changes to 
simplify the accounting rate filing requirements, including the elimination of the requirement that 
carriers making accounting rate filings with the Commission serve every carrier that provides 
service on the international route with a copy of the filing.  Instead, the Commission encouraged 
carriers to make their accounting rate filings electronically over the International Bureau 
Electronic Filing System. 
Recommendation
The staff does not believe that further amendments to subpart J are necessary at this time, and 
recommends retaining the rule.

PART 64, SUBPART K - CHANGING LONG DISTANCE SERVICE
Description
Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,  requires the Commission to 
prescribe verification procedures for telecommunications carriers to use in confirming 
subscribers' decisions to change local exchange or long distance telephone carriers.  Section 258 
provides that a carrier that fails to comply with the Commission's verification procedures will be 
liable to the subscriber's authorized carrier for all amounts paid by the subscriber after the 
violation.  Subpart K implements section 258 of the Act by requiring telecommunications carriers 
to follow specific procedures with respect to changes in subscribers' preferred carriers.  The rules 
also absolve subscribers of liability for charges billed by unauthorized carriers in certain cases, 
impose liability on unauthorized carriers for all charges collected from subscribers, and establish 
procedures to govern preferred carrier freezes.
Purpose
Subpart K is intended to implement section 258 of the Act by attempting to eliminate the 
fraudulent practice of "slamming," or changing a subscriber's authorized carrier without the 
subscriber's knowledge or explicit authorization.  Subpart K is also designed to foster consumer 
choice and facilitate fair competition in the market for telecommunications services
Analysis
 Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers.
Advantages
Subpart K reduces fraud by deterring slamming, fosters consumer choice, and facilitates fair 
competition. 
Disadvantages
Compliance with the safeguards in subpart K may increase carriers' costs to some degree.
Recent Efforts
In May 2000, the Commission modified the slamming liability rules and the procedures contained 
in subpart K.   Among other things, the Commission modified the liability rules in response to 
industry concerns about complexity and expense of implementation and permitted state 
regulatory commissions to become the primary forums for resolving slamming complaints.  In 
June 2000, the D.C. Circuit lifted its May 1999 stay of the previous liability rules.  The new rules 
will become effective later this year.
In July 2000, the Commission revised other aspects of its slamming rules to improve the carrier 
change process for both subscribers and carriers while making it more difficult for unscrupulous 
carriers to perpetrate slams.   Among other things, the Commission allowed the authorization 
and verification of carrier changes using the Internet, consistent with the provisions of the 
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.   The revised rules will become 
effective later this year.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend further changes to subpart K as part of the 2000 Biennial Review.

PART 64, SUBPART L - RESTRICTIONS ON TELEPHONE SOLICITATION 
Description
Section 227 of the Communications Act, as amended, imposes restrictions on the use of 
automatic telephone dialing systems ("autodialers"), artificial or prerecorded messages, and 
telephone facsimile machines, and it specifically requires that the Commission adopt rules to 
implement these protections.   Section 227 also directs the Commission to conduct proceedings 
to consider the need to protect residential telephone subscribers from unsolicited telephone calls.  
The subpart L rules contain measures designed to implement these provisions of the statute.  
Among other things, the subpart L rules require that telephone solicitors maintain company-
specific lists of residential subscribers who do not wish to receive further solicitations.  In 
addition, the subpart L rules contain restrictions on the disclosure of subscriber billing name and 
address information.
Purpose
The subpart L rules are intended to implement section 227 of the Act, and protect subscriber 
privacy and public safety without unnecessarily restricting legitimate telephone marketing and 
sales. 
Analysis
Status of Competition 
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers.
Advantages
Subpart L protects subscriber privacy and public safety without unnecessarily interfering with 
legitimate telephone marketing. 
Disadvantages
Subpart L restricts the ability of telemarketers to place unsolicited calls at will.
Recent Efforts
There have not been any significant recent actions.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend changes in subpart L at this time.

PART 64, SUBPART M - PROVISION OF PAYPHONE SERVICE
Description
Subpart M implements section 276 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, concerning 
the provision of payphone service.   The subpart governs the compensation of payphone 
providers by carriers that receive calls from payphones, requires states to review and remove any 
of their regulations that limit the ability of payphone service providers to enter or exit the market, 
and establishes regulations designed to ensure the accessibility of payphone service to individuals 
with disabilities.  With respect to payphone compensation, the subpart provides for contracts 
between providers, but sets a default compensation rate should the parties not reach an agreement.  
The subpart also requires carriers to establish arrangements and track the data necessary for the 
calculation, verification, billing, and collection of payphone compensation.
Purpose
Subpart M is designed to implement section 276 of the Act and help ensure that payphone 
providers receive fair compensation for completed intrastate and interstate calls that use their 
payphones, to encourage competition among payphone service providers, and to promote the 
widespread deployment of payphone services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Incumbent local exchange carriers have significant market power in the provision of payphone 
service.  Independent payphone providers have captured approximately fifteen percent of the 
payphone market.
Advantages
The payphone regulations act to restrain the market power of incumbent LECs and ensure that 
payphone providers are fairly compensated through a default rate.
Disadvantages
By establishing a default payphone compensation rate, the payphone rules may discourage 
negotiated, market-based compensation arrangements because neither side has the incentive to 
disadvantage itself in relation to the default rate.
Recent Efforts
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on June 16, 2000 upholding the 
Commission's decision to establish a default compensation rate of $.24 per call for payphone 
calls. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends retention of the payphone rules, but recommends continued monitoring to 
assess future competitive developments in the payphone market.  The staff recommends deletion 
of section 64.1320, which applies only to activities prior to January 1, 1999.


PART 64, SUBPART N - EXPANDED INTERCONNECTION
Description
Subpart N provides that Class A local exchange carriers, which do not participate in the National 
Exchange Carrier Association tariff, must provide expanded interconnection.   Subpart N 
requires that these incumbent LECs allow interconnection with their networks through physical or 
virtual collocation for the provision of interstate special access and switched transport services.  
Any interested party may take expanded interconnection.  Subpart N was adopted pursuant to the 
Commission's authority under Sections 1, 4, and 201 through 205 of the Communications Act, as 
amended.  
Purpose
Subpart N is designed to increase competition in the provision of interstate services by removing 
barriers to the competitive provision of special access and switched transport services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers.
Advantages
Subpart N fosters competition in the provision of special access and switched transport services.  
In particular, subpart N makes collocation and interconnection available to a broader group of 
interested parties than section 251 of the Communications Act and Part 51 of the Commission's 
rules.  Any interested party, including end users such as large businesses and universities, for 
example, can take advantage of expanded interconnection under subpart N, while interconnection 
and collocation under section 251 of the Communications Act and Part 51 of the Commission's 
rules are limited to telecommunications carriers. 
Disadvantages
Subpart N imposes some costs on incumbent LECs, which are passed on to requesting parties. 
Recent Efforts
No recent action.
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission retain subpart N because it covers more interested 
parties than section 251 of the Act and Part 51 of the rules, and serves to promote competition.

PART 64, SUBPART O - INTERSTATE PAY-PER-CALL AND OTHER INFORMATION 
SERVICES
Description 
Subpart O contains provisions concerning pay-per-call and certain other information services.  
Subpart O requires that common carriers assigning telephone numbers to providers of interstate 
pay-per-call services require that the provider comply with this subpart as well as certain other 
laws and regulations.  Subpart O restricts the provision of pay-per-call services over 800 and 
other "toll free" numbers, and effectively bars the provision of interstate pay-per-call services on 
a collect basis.  Subpart O provides for the assignment of the 900 service access code to pay-per-
call services.  It requires that local exchange carriers offer subscribers the option of blocking 
access to 900 numbers from their telephones.  Subpart O also bars the disconnection or 
interruption of local exchange or long distance service for the non-payment of charges for 
interstate pay-per-call and certain information services.  In addition, subpart O establishes 
conditions for common carrier provision of billing and collection for pay-per-call services.  The 
requirements in subpart O are based on the Commission's authority under Sections 1, 4, and 
201through 205 of the Communications Act, as amended. 
Purpose
Subpart O is designed to protect consumers from the fraudulent or unscrupulous provision of pay-
per-call services.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers
Advantages
Subpart O protects consumers from the fraudulent or unscrupulous provision of pay-per-call 
services.
Disadvantages
Compliance with the requirements of subpart O increases the cost of providing pay-per-call 
services.
Recent Efforts
There have not been any recent actions.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend changes to subpart O as part of the current biennial review.


 PART 64, SUBPART P - CALLING PARTY TELEPHONE NUMBER; PRIVACY  (ALSO KNOWN 
AS "CALLER ID") 
Description
Subpart P contains the Commission's rules concerning Calling Party Number (CPN) services, 
including "Caller ID," which depend on capabilities that use out-of-band signaling techniques, 
such as Signaling System Seven (SS7).  Subpart P provides that common carriers using SS7 must, 
subject to certain exceptions, transmit the CPN associated with interstate calls to interconnecting 
carriers without additional charge.  Originating carriers using SS7 must recognize *67 as a 
caller's request for privacy when dialed as the first three digits of an interstate call.  Carriers 
providing line blocking services are required to recognize *82 as a caller's request that privacy 
not be provided and that the CPN be passed on an interstate call.  Subpart P restricts the use of 
telephone subscriber information provided as part of Automatic Number Identification or Charge 
Number services.  Carriers are also required to notify customers of their *67 and *82 capabilities.  
The requirements in subpart P are based on the Commission's authority under sections 1, 4, and 
201 through 205 of the Communications Act, as amended. 
Purpose
Subpart P provides a clear and consistent regulatory framework for deployment of CPN-based 
services which protects subscriber privacy while fostering the development of new and innovative 
services. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition for 
business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers. 
Advantages 
Subpart P protects the privacy interests of telephone users, and provides for consumer education 
concerning CPN-based interstate services. 
Disadvantages
Compliance with subpart P imposes some costs on carriers.
Recent Efforts
No recent actions.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend that the Commission modify subpart P as part of this biennial 
review.


PART 64, SUBPART Q - IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 273(D)(5) OF THE 
COMMUNICATIONS ACT: DISPUTE RESOLUTION REGARDING EQUIPMENT STANDARDS
Description 
Section 273(d) of the Communications Act, as amended, establishes procedures to be followed by 
non-accredited standards organizations when setting industry-wide standards or generic 
requirements for telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment (CPE).  Section 
273(d)(5) of the Act directs the Commission to prescribe a dispute resolution process to be used 
when all parties involved in such standards setting cannot agree on a dispute resolution process.  
Subpart Q establishes a default dispute resolution process in response to section 273(d)(5).  It 
provides for resolution of technical disputes by a three-member panel, whose recommendation 
can be overturned if three-fourths of the funding parties vote to do so. 
Purpose
Subpart Q is designed to implement section 273(d) and ensure the fair, prompt and economical 
resolution of disputes that arise in the context of private sector development of technical 
standards for telecommunications equipment and CPE.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The market for CPE is competitive, with vibrant competition among a wide variety of CPE 
manufacturers.
Advantages
The default dispute resolution process prescribed in subpart Q provides for the fair, prompt and 
economical resolution of disputes when the parties are unable to agree on a mutually satisfactory 
process.
Disadvantages
Since this dispute resolution process is only used when the parties cannot agree on another 
approach, it does not appear to have any significant disadvantages. 
Recent Efforts
No recent action.
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission retain subpart Q.



PART 64, SUBPART R - GEOGRAPHIC RATE AVERAGING AND RATE INTEGRATION
Description 
Section 254(g) of the Communications Act, as amended,  requires interexchange rate averaging 
and rate integration.  The rate averaging provisions require interexchange carriers to charge 
customers in rural and high cost areas no more than they charge urban customers.  The rate 
integration provisions require carriers to charge customers in one state the same rates for 
interexchange service charged to customers in any other state.  Subpart R implements this 
requirement.
Purpose
Subpart R is designed to implement section 254(g) of the Act and ensure that all customers, 
regardless of where they live, have access to interexchange services at comparable rates.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The market for long distance service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high 
volume customers than for low volume customers. 
Advantages
The rate averaging and rate integration requirements help ensure that all domestic interexchange 
toll service customers, regardless of where they live, share in the benefits of rate reductions and 
new technologies that result from the competitive nature of the interexchange market.
Disadvantages
By requiring carriers to average their rates across all of their service areas, the rate averaging and 
rate integration provisions in the statute create implicit subsidies running from low-cost areas to 
high-cost areas.  This has the potential to distort the market by discouraging carriers from serving 
high cost areas.  It can also make it difficult for national interexchange carriers serving both high 
and low cost areas to compete effectively with carriers that provide targeted interexchange 
services in low-cost areas. 
Recent Efforts
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently affirmed the Commission's ruling that an 
interexchange carrier and all of its affiliates must charge the same integrated long distance rates.  
The court, however, vacated the Commission's decision that Section 254(g) unambiguously 
applies rate integration to CMRS carriers and remanded to the Commission the question of 
whether rate integration should apply to these carriers. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends review of the applicability of rate integration to CMRS carriers pursuant to 
the court remand, but does not recommend that this be treated as a part of the 2000 Biennial 
Review.  The staff recommends retention of the other rate integration and rate averaging rules 
that implement the statutory mandate of the 1996 Act.  The staff recommends that the 
Commission monitor the potential effect of these provisions on the development of competition 
in the interexchange market.

PART 64, SUBPART S - NONDOMINANT INTEREXCHANGE CARRIER CERTIFICATIONS 
REGARDING GEOGRAPHIC RATE AVERAGING AND RATE INTEGRATION 
REQUIREMENTS
Description 
Section 254(g) of the Communications Act, as amended, requires interexchange carrier rate 
averaging and rate integration.  Subpart S implements this requirement by requiring that 
nondominant carriers that provide detariffed interstate domestic interexchange service file an 
annual certification with the Commission (signed by an officer under oath), stating that they 
comply with the rate averaging and rate integration requirements in section 254(g).
Purpose
Subpart S is intended to implement section 254(g) and insure compliance with the statutory 
requirement that all customers, regardless of where they live, have access to interexchange 
services at comparable rates.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The market for long distance service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high 
volume customers than for low volume customers.
Advantages
The rate averaging and rate integration certification requirements facilitate enforcement of the 
statutory requirement in section 254(g) of the Act that all domestic interexchange toll service 
customers, regardless of where they live, share in the benefits of rate reductions and new 
technologies that result from the competitive nature of the interexchange market.
Disadvantages
Requiring that nondominant interexchange carriers file annual certifications may impose some 
administrative costs on these carriers. 
Recent Efforts
There have been no recent actions.
Recommendation
The staff recommends retention of subpart S.

 PART 64, SUBPART T - SEPARATE AFFILIATE REQUIREMENTS FOR INCUMBENT 
INDEPENDENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS THAT PROVIDE IN-REGION, INTERSTATE 
DOMESTIC INTEREXCHANGE SERVICES OR IN-REGION INTERNATIONAL 
INTEREXCHANGE SERVICES
Description 
Subpart T establishes separate subsidiary requirements applicable to the provision of in-region, 
interstate domestic, interexchange services and in-region international interexchange services by 
incumbent independent local exchange carriers.  Subpart T generally requires that the separate 
affiliate: (1) maintain separate books of account, although these books of account need not 
comply with Part 32 requirements; (2) not own transmission or switching facilities jointly with its 
affiliated exchange company, although the separate affiliate may share personnel or other assets 
or resources with an affiliated exchange company; (3) take, pursuant to tariff, any services for 
which its affiliated exchange carrier is required to file a tariff, although the separate affiliate may 
also take unbundled network elements and services for resale pursuant to the terms of pre-existing 
negotiated agreements approved under section 252 of the Act; and (4) be a separate legal entity 
from the affiliated exchange company, although the separate affiliate may share personnel, office 
space and marketing with the affiliated exchange companies.  Subpart T was adopted pursuant to 
sections 1, 2, 4, 201, 202, 220, 251, 271, 272 and 303(r) of the Communications Act, as 
amended.  
Purpose
Subpart T is designed to prevent incumbent independent local exchange carriers from exercising 
market power in the provision of in-region long distance services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers.
Advantages
By requiring a separate affiliate for the provision of in-region long distance service by 
independent incumbent local exchange carriers, subpart T helps to prevent these carriers from 
exercising market power in the provision of in-region long distance services.
Disadvantages
Subpart T may increase independent incumbent local exchange carriers' costs of providing in-
region, interstate, interexchange services.  Additionally, section 64.1903(c) is no longer 
applicable since it addresses exclusively the time period prior to August 30, 1999.
Recent Efforts
In August 1999, the Commission revised subpart T to allow independent LECs providing in-
region long distance services solely on a resale basis to do so through a separate corporate 
division rather than through a separate legal entity. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission modify subpart T to provide for triennial review of 
the requirement that independent incumbent LECs provide interexchange service through a 
separate affiliate.  The staff also recommends that the Commission delete section 64.1903(c), 
since it pertains exclusively to the time period prior to August 31, 1999.

PART 64, SUBPART U - CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION
Description
Section 222 of the Communications Act, as amended,   restricts carrier use of customer 
proprietary network information (CPNI), which, among other things, identifies to whom, where, 
and when a customer places a call, and identifies the types of service offerings to which the 
customer subscribes and the extent to which the service is used.  The Commission adopted CPNI 
rules pursuant to section 222, but the order adopting those rules was overturned on appeal, as 
discussed in more detail below.   Section 222 remains in effect, however, and the Commission 
has authority to enforce the CPNI protections in that section. 
Purpose
The Commission adopted the CPNI rules in order to implement the provisions of section 222 and 
protect consumer privacy and foster competition.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is fully competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than 
for low volume customers. 
Advantages
The CPNI rules protect consumer privacy and foster competition.
Disadvantages
The CPNI rules adopted by the Commission impose some costs on carriers.  The 10th Circuit 
Court of Appeals decision concerning the Commission's CPNI rules is discussed below.
Recent Efforts
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Commission's interpretation of the customer 
approval requirement for the use of CPNI in certain circumstances violated the First Amendment.  
Although the court did not discuss other aspects of the Commission's rules, its opinion concluded 
by vacating the Commission order adopting the CPNI rules.  The court did not address the 
constitutionality of section 222, which remains in effect and continues to protect customer CPNI. 
The Commission is in the process of addressing the court's ruling. 
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend that the Commission take action concerning subpart U as part of 
the 2000 Biennial Review.

PART 64, SUBPART V - TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER SYSTEMS SECURITY AND 
INTEGRITY PURSUANT TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ASSISTANCE FOR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ACT (CALEA)
Description
Section 105 of CALEA,  requires that telecommunications carriers establish safeguards to 
ensure that interception of communications or access to call-identifying information can be 
activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization, and with the 
affirmative intervention of an officer or employee.  Subpart V implements this CALEA 
requirement by mandating that carriers adopt policies and procedures for supervision and control 
of their employees and officers in this regard, and by requiring that carriers maintain secure 
records of each interception of communications or access to call-identifying information.  Each 
telecommunication carrier is required to submit its policies and procedures to the Commission for 
review.
Purpose
Subpart V is intended to implement section 105 of CALEA and help protect subscribers' privacy 
rights by ensuring that any interception is in accordance with legal authorization.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not relevant. 
Advantages
Subpart V helps protect subscriber privacy.
Disadvantages
Compliance with these requirements increases carrier costs.
Recent Efforts
Subpart V was adopted in September 1999. 
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend that the Commission modify subpart V as part of its 2000 Biennial 
Review.

PART 64, SUBPART W - REQUIRED NEW CAPABILITIES PURSUANT TO THE 
COMMUNICATIONS ASSISTANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT (CALEA)
Description
Subpart W establishes the technical requirements and standards that telecommunications carriers 
must satisfy to ensure that, when properly authorized, law enforcement officials have access to 
communications and call-identifying information, as required by section 103 of CALEA.   
Subpart W parallels requirements and standards for wireless telecommunications carriers set out 
in Part 22, subpart J and Part 24, subpart J.
Purpose
Subpart W is intended to implement section 103 of CALEA and assist in enforcement of criminal 
laws, and to clarify what telecommunications carriers must do in order to satisfy the requirements 
of section 103(a) of CALEA.   
Analysis
Status of Competition
Not relevant.
Advantages
Subpart W facilitates enforcement of criminal law and clarifies what carriers must do in order to 
comply with CALEA. 
Disadvantages
Compliance with these requirements increases carriers' costs.
Recent Efforts
On August 15, 2000, the D.C. Circuit affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part the 
requirements contained in subpart W. 
Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission reassess its subpart W rules pursuant to the D.C. 
Circuit's remand.

PART 64, SUBPART X - SUBSCRIBER LIST INFORMATION
Description
Section 222(e) of the Communications Act  requires carriers providing telephone exchange 
service to provide subscriber list information to requesting directory publishers "on a timely and 
unbundled basis, under nondiscriminatory and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions." Subpart 
X implements this statutory provision, addressing third party rights to subscriber list information, 
which includes listed subscribers' names, addresses and telephone numbers, as well as headings 
under which businesses are listed in the yellow pages.  
Purpose
Subpart X is intended to implement section 222(e) of the Act and encourage the development of 
competition in directory publishing by ensuring that competing directory publishers can obtain 
subscriber list information from local exchange carriers.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The market for directory publishing has been dominated by incumbent LEC publishing 
operations, but is becoming increasingly competitive.  Much of this increased competition is due 
to section 222 and the Commission's implementing rules in subpart X.
Advantages
Subpart X fosters competition in directory publishing, and prevents incumbent local exchange 
carriers from using control of their subscriber information lists to undermine competition in the 
directory publishing business. 
Disadvantages
These requirements may place some administrative burdens on local exchange carriers.
Recent Efforts
The Commission adopted the subpart X rules on August 23, 1999.  
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend that the Commission modify subpart X at this time. 

PART 64, SUBPART Y - TRUTH-IN-BILLING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMON CARRIERS
Description
The Commission adopted the rules in subpart Y pursuant to its authority under sections 201(b) 
and 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.   Subpart Y contains binding truth-in-
billing guidelines that apply to carriers selling telecommunications services.  Subpart Y requires 
carriers to provide customers with necessary information about the services and charges that are 
shown on the customer's bill in a user-friendly format.  Specifically, subpart Y requires carriers 
to separate charges on the bill by provider, to describe clearly the services involved, to display 
clearly the name of the service provider in association with its charges, to display a toll-free 
number (or, in certain cases, a website) for consumer inquiries, to identify those charges for 
which failure to pay will not result in disconnection of the customer's basic local service, and to 
highlight new service providers.
Purpose
Subpart Y is designed to implement sections 201(b) and 258 of the Act and make telephone bills 
easier for consumers to understand, so that customers can make informed choices among carriers 
and services in the increasingly competitive telecommunications market.  Subpart Y is also 
intended to make it easier for consumers to identify and report fraud, such as slamming 
(unauthorized change of consumer's telecommunications carrier) and cramming (placement of 
unauthorized, misleading, or deceptive charges on a consumer's telephone bill).
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas.  The market for long distance 
service is competitive, although there is greater competition for high volume customers than for 
low volume customers.
Advantages
Subpart Y makes telephone bills easier for customers to understand and ensures that consumers 
have the information necessary to make informed choices among carriers and services.  These 
rules also make it easier for consumers to detect and report fraud in the provision of 
telecommunications services such as slamming and cramming.
Disadvantages
These requirements may increase carrier costs somewhat.
Recent Efforts
Some of the truth-in-billing rules contained in subpart Y took effect in November 1999, and 
several more took effect in April 2000.  
In March 2000, the Commission modified the truth in billing rules slightly, specifying that the 
requirement that telephone bills highlight new service providers does not apply to services billed 
solely on a per-transaction basis, and making other minor modifications.   These changes 
became effective on August 28, 2000.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend further changes to subpart Y as part of the 2000 Biennial Review.


PART 65 - INTERSTATE RATE OF RETURN PRESCRIPTION PROCEDURES AND 
METHODOLOGIES
Description
Section 201 of the Communications Act, as amended, requires that rates for common carrier 
communications services be just and reasonable.   Part 65 sets forth procedures and 
methodologies used by the Commission to prescribe an authorized interstate rate-of-return for the 
exchange access services of incumbent local exchange carriers subject to rate-of-return 
regulation.  Price cap incumbent local exchange carriers also use the Commission prescribed rate-
of-return for certain limited purposes.  The Part 65 rules describe the methodologies to be used in 
calculating the cost of equity, the cost of debt, the weighted average cost of capital (both equity 
and debt), the interstate ratebase, and the carriers' interstate rate-of-return.  These rules also 
require the filing of certain rate-of-return reports.
Part 65 is organized into seven lettered subparts.
	A - General
	B - Procedures
	C - Exchange Carriers
	D - Interexchange Carriers
	E - Rate-of-Return Reports
	F - Maximum Allowable Rates of Return
	G - Rate Base 	  

Purpose 
The Part 65 rules are designed to protect consumers from excessive rates by prescribing an 
authorized interstate rate of return used to set local exchange access rates for incumbent local 
exchange carriers subject to rate-of-return regulation.  (End users pay the subscriber line charge 
element of interstate access charges directly.  Other interstate access charges are paid by the 
interexchange carriers and reflected in their interstate long distance rates.) 
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers in rural areas.
Advantages
The Part 65 rules protect consumers from excessive interstate access charges by incumbent local 
exchange carriers subject to rate-of-return regulation.  The authorized interstate rate of return is 
also used by incumbent local exchange carriers for certain purposes, for example, calculating 
payments to and disbursements from the universal service fund and in the low end adjustment 
formula.
Disadvantages
The Part 65 rules impose some paperwork burdens on carriers. 
Recent Efforts
In 1995, the Commission substantially reformed the Part 65 rules.  The major changes made by 
the 1995 order were the elimination of the biennial represcription schedule, and simplification of 
the represcription process.  The Commission replaced the existing rule, which called for the 
initiation of rate return represcription proceedings every two years, with a semiautomatic trigger 
activated by changes in capital costs.   
In October 1998, the Common Carrier Bureau initiated a proceeding to represcribe the rate of 
return.   This proceeding has not yet been completed.
Recommendation
The staff does not recommend changes in the Part 65 rules at this time.

PART 68 - CONNECTION OF TERMINAL EQUIPMENT TO THE TELEPHONE NETWORK
Description
Part 68 was established in 1974 as the result of a court decision ruling that the Bell Operating 
Companies could not bar direct connection of customer premises equipment (CPE) (such as 
telephones, fax machines, modems, etc.) to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), so 
long as the CPE would not cause harm to the PSTN.   Part 68 requires that CPE be tested to 
show that it will not harm the PSTN or carrier personnel, and then registered with the 
Commission.  Carriers are obligated to permit the free connection of registered CPE to the PSTN, 
but they can require disconnection of unregistered CPE or of CPE that causes harm to the PSTN 
without recourse to litigation.  Part 68 also establishes the right of customers to use competitively 
provided inside wiring.
In addition, Part 68 implements a statutory requirement for telephone equipment compatibility 
with hearing aids,  and contains two consumer protection provisions mandated by statute: a 
requirement that all fax transmissions include source labeling,  and a requirement that CPE 
support equal access to providers of operator services. 
Part 68 is organized into six lettered subparts:
	A - General
	B - Conditions on Use of Terminal Equipment
	C - Registration Procedures
	D - Conditions for Registration
	E - Complaint Procedures
	F - Connectors 

Purpose
The Part 68 rules are designed to foster competition in the provision of CPE and inside wiring by 
permitting the connection of competitively provided CPE and inside wiring to the PSTN.  Part 68 
is also intended to ensure that the connection of CPE and inside wiring does not harm the PSTN 
or injure personnel.  In addition, Part 68 is designed to ensure the compatibility of hearing aids 
and telephone receivers so that persons with hearing aids will be able to use virtually all 
telephones.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
The market for CPE and the market for the installation of inside wiring in single family 
residences are fully competitive.
Advantages
Part 68 benefits consumers by fostering competition in the provision of CPE and inside wiring.  
The competition engendered by Part 68 has greatly increased innovation in CPE and reduced 
prices.  Part 68 also benefits consumers and the industry by preventing harm to the PSTN and 
carrier personnel.  In addition, Part 68 benefits people with hearing disabilities and those who 
communicate with these people by requiring that telephone receivers be compatible with hearing 
aids. 
Disadvantages
The present Part 68 requirements for CPE registration impose additional costs on manufacturers 
and may delay customer access to new CPE.  The present Part 68 registration program also uses 
Commission resources that might otherwise be available for other priorities.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission is taking steps to streamline the Part 68 CPE registration process.  On June 2, 
2000, the Commission implemented measures allowing private entities to register CPE, ending 
the policy of having the Commission perform this function on an exclusive basis.   A Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, released May 22, 2000 in CC Docket No. 99-216, proposes that the 
Commission cease performing all registration functions other than consideration of appeals, thus 
entirely privatizing CPE registration.   In the May 22 Notice, the Commission also proposes to 
privatize the development of technical criteria that CPE must meet in order to be registered.
Recommendation
The staff recommends continuation of the basic Part 68 requirement that LECs must allow the 
connection of Part 68-compliant CPE and inside wiring to the PSTN.  The staff also recommends 
continuing the requirements for hearing aid compatibility and the other consumer protection 
requirements in Part 68.  In addition, the staff recommends continuation of the Commission's 
ongoing efforts in CC Docket No. 99-216 to streamline and privatize the development of 
technical standards and the CPE registration process.  

PART 69 - ACCESS CHARGES
Description 
Sections 201 and 202 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, require that rates, terms 
and conditions for telecommunications services be just and reasonable,  and prohibit unjust or 
unreasonable discrimination.   Part 69 implements these sections of the Act by establishing rules 
that perform the following major functions.  First, the Part 69 rules establish the rate structure for 
access charges to be paid by interexchange carriers for the origination and termination of long 
distance calls, as well as the access charges to be paid directly by end users.   These rate 
structure rules establish the access charge rate elements as well as the nature of the charges, such 
as whether they are assessed on a per minute or a flat-rate basis.  Second, the Part 69 rules govern 
how rate-of-return LECs calculate their access charge rates.  Third, the Part 69 rules, in 
conjunction with the Part 61 price cap rules, establish the degree of pricing flexibility available to 
price-cap LECs.  Finally, Part 69 provides for the establishment of the National Exchange Carrier 
Association (NECA), which files tariffs on behalf of many of the smaller, rate-of-return LECs.
Part 69 is organized into eight lettered subparts:
A - General
B - Computation of Charges
C - Computation of Charges for Price Cap Local Exchange Carriers
D - Apportionment of Net Investment
E - Apportionment of Expenses
F - Segregation of Common Line Element Revenue Requirement
G - Exchange Carrier Association
H - Pricing Flexibility

Purpose
The Part 69 rules are designed to implement the provisions of sections 201 and 202 of the Act and 
protect consumers by preventing the exercise of market power by incumbent LECs and ensuring 
that rates are just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.  The requirement 
for a certain minimum set of access charge rate elements and the rate calculation rules for rate-of-
return carriers also greatly reduce the resources required in the tariff review process.
Analysis
Status of Competition
Competition in the local exchange and exchange access markets is growing, although competitive 
local exchange carriers still serve only a small percentage of local exchange lines.  Competition 
for business customers in metropolitan areas has, in general, developed more rapidly than 
competition for residential customers or customers in rural areas. 
 Advantages
The Part 69 rules protect customers from the exercise of market power by incumbent LECs.  The 
requirement for a minimum set of access charge rate elements and the pricing rules for both rate-
of return and price-cap LECs greatly reduce the Commission resources required to ensure carrier 
compliance with sections 201 and 202 of the Act.  These requirements also greatly facilitate 
analysis of access charges by other interested parties.  The creation of NECA facilitates the filing 
of access charge tariffs by smaller rate-of-return LECs and reduces the administrative costs 
involved 
Disadvantages
The requirement that the LECs offer a minimum set of access charge rate elements limits their 
flexibility and could over time reduce their ability to respond appropriately to competition.  The 
pricing rules for both price-cap and rate-of-return LECs could also undermine their ability to 
respond to competition if not adjusted over time.  The pooling of revenues and costs under the 
NECA tariffs reduces the incentives of individual carriers to improve efficiency.
Recent Efforts
The Commission recently addressed the access charge rules applicable to price cap LECs in the 
CALLS proceeding.   The Commission has also established rules permitting price cap LECs 
greater pricing flexibility as they achieve specified competitive milestones.   In addition, the 
Commission is seeking comment on issues relating to further pricing flexibility.  The 
Commission has also initiated a rulemaking proceeding addressing issues relating to access 
charge reform for rate-of-return LECs. 
Recommendation
In light of recent Commission decisions concerning Part 69 discussed above, the staff does not 
recommend any new initiatives relating to Part 69 in the context of this biennial regulatory 
review.  The ongoing proceedings addressing issues of access charge reform provide an 
appropriate means of addressing competitive developments in the exchange access market.  We 
also note that the inter-carrier compensation proceeding that the staff recommends in the text of 
this report could result in revisions to Part 69 that would address anticipated competitive 
developments.
The staff recommends deleting a number of provisions that apply only to past time periods, or are 
otherwise no longer in effect, including sections 69.116, 69.117, 69.126, 69.127, and 69.612.

PART 73, -RADIO BROADCAST SERVICES, SECTION 73.3555 - THE BROADCAST 
OWNERSHIP RULES
Description
Statutory authority for section 73.3555 of the Commission's rules is found in sections 308, 309 
and 310 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  Section 308 requires the filing of a 
written application for licenses and construction permits (except in certain narrow enumerated 
cases) and states that such applications shall set forth such facts as the Commission may 
prescribe, including the ownership and location of the proposed station.  Section 309 requires the 
Commission, except in the case of certain designated applications, to determine whether the grant 
of an application would serve the public interest, and to grant the application upon such a finding.  
Section 310(d) specifies that no construction permit or license shall be transferred without first 
filing an application with the Commission and without the Commission's finding that the public 
interest would be served thereby.  Section 73.3555 contains the rules limiting the degree of 
common ownership of radio and television stations.  It also contains attribution rules that specify 
when interests in mass media facilities will be considered cognizable for purposes of applying the 
mass media ownership rules.
Purpose
The broadcast ownership rules are intended to foster diversity and competition in broadcasting.
Analysis
Status of Competition
For an assessment of competition in broadcasting, see section V of the Report.
Advantages
The Commission is precluded from regulating the content of programming by section 326 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and by the First Amendment.  The ownership rules 
are a structural method of ensuring diversity of viewpoints in broadcasting.  The rules are also 
intended to foster competition in broadcasting.
Disadvantages
Broadcasters allege that the rules restrict mass media entities in competing with other content 
providers that are not subject to ownership rules and restrict scale efficiencies.
Recent Efforts
Section V of the Report details the Commission's recent reviews of the ownership rules, 
including that contained in the recently released 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review Report. 
Recommendation 
Section V of the Report details a recommendation with respect to each of the ownership rules 
contained in section 73.3555.

PART 80 - STATIONS IN THE MARITIME SERVICES, SUBPARTS J (PUBLIC COAST 
STATIONS) AND Y (COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEDURES)
Description
Part 80  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for radio stations in the maritime 
services, which provide for the distress, operational, and personal communications needs of 
vessels at sea and on inland waterways.   Maritime frequencies are allocated internationally by 
geographic region and type of communication in order to facilitate interoperable radio 
communications among vessels of all nations and stations on land worldwide.  Land stations in 
the maritime services are the links between vessels at sea and activities on shore.  They are spread 
throughout the coastal and inland areas of the United States to carry radio signals and messages to 
and from ships.
For purposes of the Biennial Regulatory Review, the analysis of Part 80 in this report focuses on 
the rules affecting public coast stations (subparts J and Y), which are unique in the Maritime 
Services in that they are used for commercial applications, are licensed on a geographic 
exclusive-use basis, and are subject to licensing by the Commission's competitive bidding 
procedures.  
Public coast stations are commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers that allow ships to 
send and receive messages and to interconnect with the public switched telephone network.  
VHF band (156-162 MHz) public coast stations (VPC) provide short-range communications for 
vessels not more than 30 nautical miles from shore.  High seas band (2-27.5 MHz) public coast 
stations serve vessels far from shore.  Automated Maritime Telecommunications System (AMTS) 
stations are a special type of public coast station operating in the 216-220 MHz band.  AMTS 
stations are licensed to provide coverage over an entire inland waterway or a substantial portion 
of an ocean coastline.
Public coast stations are common carriers, and thus charge a fee for providing voice, telex, fax, or 
data transmission services.  Public coast stations also provide a vital public service because they 
can reach well beyond the limits of terrestrial radio systems and are required by statute to relay 
distress messages free of charge.
Purpose
The primary purpose of the Maritime Services is to provide for the safety of life and property at 
sea.   The specific purpose of the Part 80 public coast station rules is to establish the mechanism 
for allocating licenses, to ensure spectrum use that provides public coast licensees with maximum 
flexibility while concurrently respecting the unique nature of maritime spectrum, and to prevent 
interference.  Public coast stations provide commercial operational and general purpose 
communications between ship and shore and between ships that are out of each others' radio 
range.
Analysis
Status of Competition
While competition in the CMRS industry as a whole continues to benefit from the effects of 
increased competition, as evidenced by lower prices to consumers and increased diversity of 
service offerings, competition is generally less robust in the public coast services, due in part to 
the unique nature of maritime communications and the predominant safety-of-life 
communications responsibilities required of licensees.  In addition, other CMRS services - such 
as cellular and PCS - can serve as substitutes for commercial ship-to-shore communications, 
particularly for vessels operating near the coast and on inland waterways.  Large-scale public 
coast operators - particularly MariTel - are becoming predominant in VPC as many small and 
independent licensees leave the business.  Competition is stronger in AMTS than on the high seas 
band.
Advantages
The public coast station rules promote the safety of life and property at sea, while concurrently 
providing public coast licensees with the opportunity to compete as CMRS providers.  For 
example, the rules provide for licensing of VPC on a geographic basis, allow partitioning and 
disaggregation, and permit VPC licensees to utilize capacity not needed for maritime service to 
provide other types of services.   These characteristics are consistent with the regulatory 
flexibility the Commission has provided in other competitive services.  
The subpart Y competitive bidding rules establish procedures for the efficient licensing of 
spectrum.  Use of auction procedures allows for substantially faster licensing than alternative 
licensing methods such as lotteries and comparative hearings, and is more likely to result in 
award of licenses to those entities that value the spectrum the most and will use it most 
efficiently.  Auction rules also enable the Commission to recover a portion of the value of the 
spectrum for the benefit of the public.
Disadvantages
Because of the unique characteristics of the maritime services, public coast station licensees are 
subject to responsibilities that other CMRS providers do not face.  The international allocation of 
maritime frequencies and the associated statutes, treaties, and agreements limit the flexibility of 
use of maritime frequencies.  Because two frequency blocks are allocated to AMTS, competition 
is limited to two competitors at any location and disaggregation is not currently available in 
AMTS.  There are additional administrative burdens associated with the competitive bidding of 
public coast station licenses, including filing and reporting requirements, as well as the cost of 
maintaining staff and electronic resources to participate in auctions.  Nevertheless, the delays 
associated with this process are significantly less than those historically associated with licensing 
by lottery or hearing.
Recent Efforts
In the 1998 Maritime Third Report and Order in the Maritime Services proceeding, the 
Commission substantially revised the public coast service rules to provide opportunities for the 
development of competitive new services, streamline licensing procedures, promote technological 
innovation, and enhance regulatory symmetry between maritime CMRS providers and other 
CMRS providers.   For example, VPS and AMTS stations may now provide service to units on 
land, provided that priority is given to marine originating communications.  In addition, in 
December 1998, the Commission held its first auction of spectrum in the public coast service, 
which resulted in the award of 26 VHF public coast station licenses. 
Recommendation
The Maritime Services proceeding has established the framework for increased competition 
within the public coast service, and between public coast stations and other CMRS providers.  
Moreover, licensees that acquired their licenses in the 1998 auction are still engaged in buildout 
of their networks.  For these reasons, the staff does not believe that there is a need to revise the 
existing maritime rules in order to further competition.  The staff recommends that for the time 
being, only nonsubstantive revisions be made to the structure of the Part 80 rules, to simplify and 
provide clarity to licensees and applicants.

PART 90 - PRIVATE LAND MOBILE RADIO SERVICES.
Description
Part 90  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the group of mobile services 
historically described as "private land mobile radio services" or "PLMRS."  Services regulated 
under this rule part include commercial services such as Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) and 
private carrier paging (PCP), non-commercial services such as public safety, and services that are 
used by utilities, transportation companies, and other businesses for both commercial and private 
internal purposes.  
Prior to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),  all Part 90 
services were classified as private, i.e., non-common carrier, services.  With the passage of 
OBRA, however, Congress reclassified 800 MHz and 900 MHz SMR, PCP, and some 220 MHz 
and Business Radio services as commercial mobile radio services or "CMRS," and required 
CMRS providers in these services to be regulated as common carriers.   The regulatory status of 
non-CMRS Part 90 services was not affected by OBRA, and these services continue to be 
classified as private services.  
Part 90 contains 22 subparts.  Some of these subparts apply generally to all Part 90 licensees, 
while others establish licensing, technical, and operational rules for specific services.   In 
general, the rules in this part:  (1) specify the frequency bands in which each service operates; (2) 
define the service area of licenses in each frequency band; (3) establish minimum construction or 
coverage requirements for licensees; and (4) define technical limits on operation (e.g., antenna 
height, transmitter power) to prevent interference.  For certain CMRS services, Part 90 also 
contains subparts dealing with the auction and award of licenses,  although many of these rules 
have since been consolidated in Part 1.
For purposes of the Biennial Regulatory Review, the analysis of Part 90 in this report focuses on 
those subparts that affect CMRS providers:  
Subpart L - Authorizations in 470-512 MHz Band
Subparts M, X - Intelligent Transportation Systems Radio Service/Auction Rules 
Subpart P - Paging Operations 
Subparts S, U, V - 800/900 MHz SMR Service/Auction Rules 
Subparts T, W - 220 MHz Service/Auction Rules 

Purpose
The purpose of the Part 90 rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of spectrum in 
Part 90 services, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to prevent interference.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
As detailed in the Fifth Competition Report, Part 90 CMRS providers operate in an environment 
that is marked by significant and increasing competition in mobile telephony, paging/messaging, 
and mobile data.   
Advantages
The Part 90 rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of spectrum.  In 
Part 90 frequency bands that are licensed exclusively to CMRS providers (e.g., SMR), auction 
rules promote efficient licensing of spectrum to those entities that value it the most.  In other 
bands, site-specific licensing and frequency coordination are used to promote efficient spectrum 
use.  
Disadvantages
The Part 90 rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent to the 
licensing process and that require compliance with technical and operational rules.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission has recently made changes to Part 90 in several rulemaking proceedings, as 
described in greater detail within this Staff Report.  In the Universal Licensing proceeding, the 
Commission eliminated many of the service-specific licensing rules in Part 90 as part of its 
consolidation of all wireless licensing rules into Part 1.   The Commission also made numerous 
changes to Part 90 rules in the recently adopted Report and Order in the Part 90 Biennial 
Regulatory Review proceeding.  
Recommendation
In general, the rules in this part are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for these rules is also not significantly 
affected by changes in the level of competition in wireless services.  Moreover, as noted above, 
the Commission has significantly revised and streamlined the Part 90 rules in several recent 
proceedings.  Therefore, the staff concludes that significant modification or repeal of the Part 90 
rules is not necessary at this time.  However, where modifications could be made to streamline 
the rules in specific subparts, the staff has so noted in the detailed analysis of those Part 90 
subparts.

PART 90, SUBPART L - REGULATIONS FOR AUTHORIZATION AND USE OF FREQUENCIES 
IN THE 470-512 MHZ BAND
Description
Part 90, subpart L  governs the authorization and use of the 470-512 MHz band by both 
commercial and private land mobile stations.  Frequencies in the 470-512 MHz band are shared 
with UHF-TV channels 14-20, and are therefore only available in eleven cities, with different 
frequencies allocated in each market.  Originally, channels in the 470-512 MHz band were 
allocated to seven frequency pools based on category of eligibility.  In 1997, the Commission 
eliminated the separate allocation to these pools and created a General Access Pool to permit 
greater flexibility and foster more effective and efficient use of the 470-512 MHz band.  Under 
current rules, all unassigned channels, including those that subsequently become unassigned, are 
considered to be in the General Access Pool and are available to all eligible licensees on a first-
come, first-served basis.  If a channel is assigned in an urbanized area, however, subsequent 
authorizations on that channel will only be granted to users from the same category.   
In general, the rules in subpart L: (1) specify the frequencies available for assignment in the 470-
512 MHz band; (2) define the location of stations and service area of licenses in each frequency 
block; (3) establish minimum loading requirements for licensees; and (4) define technical limits 
on operation (e.g., antenna height, transmitter power) to prevent interference.  In accordance with 
these rules, new applicants may apply for only one channel at a time.   Licensees are required to 
show that any assigned channels in this band in a particular urbanized area are at full capacity 
before they can be assigned additional 470-512 MHz channels in that area.   The rules in this 
part also specify the minimum allowable distance between co-channel stations.   For purposes of 
loading requirements, licensees in the 470-512 MHz band are divided into two groups: the Public 
Safety Pool and the Industrial/Business Pool.   After loading a channel to full capacity, a 
licensee may apply for another channel.   Current licensees may use existing loading to satisfy 
this requirement and apply for more than one channel at one time.  Licensees in the 470-512 MHz 
band that are operating above full capacity may use those units to qualify for additional channels.  
Licensees operating in other frequency bands may also use existing licensed units to qualify for 
more than one channel at one time.
Purpose
The purpose of the subpart L rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of spectrum in 
the 470-512 MHz service, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to prevent 
interference with UHF television stations operating on the shared frequencies.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Because land mobile use of the 470-512 MHz band is limited by the sharing of the band with 
broadcast channels 14-20, service in the band has been narrowly geared to industrial and public 
safety use in a limited number of urban locations.  Demand for these channels to provide 
commercial services to consumers has been largely absent. 
Advantages
The subpart L rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of spectrum.  
Site-specific licensing and frequency coordination are used to promote efficient spectrum use.  
Disadvantages
The subpart L rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent to the 
licensing process and compliance with technical and operational rules.  Because the band is 
shared with television broadcast stations, the technical burden imposed on licensees to prevent 
interference with co-channel operations is somewhat greater than in other bands allocated 
exclusively to wireless services.   
Recent Efforts
In the Second Report and Order in the Refarming proceeding, the Commission authorized 
centralized trunking in the 470-512 MHz band if a licensee has an exclusive service area or 
obtains consent from all co-channel and adjacent channel licensees and frequency coordination is 
obtained.   
Recommendation
In general, the rules in this part are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for these rules is also not significantly 
affected by changes in the level of competition in wireless services.  The staff concludes that 
significant modification or repeal of the subpart L rules is not necessary at this time


PART 90, SUBPARTS M (INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RADIO SERVICE) 
AND X (COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES FOR THE LOCATION AND MONITORING 
SERVICE)
Description
Part 90, subpart M  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS) radio service.  ITS radio service consists of two sub-categories: the 
Location and Monitoring Service (LMS) and the Dedicated Short Range Communications 
Service (DSRCS). 	
Location and Monitoring Systems (LMS)
LMS systems are used for such functions as vehicle tracking and location, automated toll 
collection, and other communications functions related to vehicles.  LMS systems operate in the 
902-928 MHz band, which they share with federal government radiolocation systems, Industrial, 
Scientific and Medical devices (LMS use is secondary to both of these uses), licensed amateur 
radio operations, and unlicensed Part 15 equipment (both of which are secondary to LMS and all 
other uses of the band).  
The subpart M LMS service rules, governing the licensing of LMS in the 902-928 MHz band, 
were adopted in 1995.   In general, the subpart M rules: (1) specify the frequency bands in 
which LMS licensees operate; (2) define the service area of LMS licenses in each frequency 
band; (3) establish minimum construction or coverage requirements for LMS licensees; and (4) 
define technical limits on operation (e.g., antenna height, transmitter power) to prevent 
interference.   The technical rules for the 902-928 MHz band contain additional provisions 
governing secondary operation by Part 15 equipment users and amateur licensees in the LMS 
band to reduce potential interference between these uses and LMS operations.  The rules also 
establish limitations on LMS systems' interconnection with the public switched network and set 
forth a number of technical requirements intended to ensure successful coexistence of all the 
services authorized to operate in the band.
The LMS competitive bidding rules, set forth in Part 90, subpart X,  were adopted in 1998.  
Section 90.1101  states that the auction of LMS licenses is generally subject to the competitive 
bidding procedures set forth in Part 1, subpart Q.  Section 90.1103  sets forth service-specific 
rules defining designated entities in LMS.  Pursuant to these rules, LMS licenses were auctioned 
by the Commission in 1999. 
Dedicated Short Range Communications Service (DSRCS)  
In October 1999, the Commission allocated 75 MHz of spectrum at 5.850-5.925 GHz for use by 
DSRCS systems operating in the Intelligent Transportation System radio service.   The 
Commission amended subpart M by adding technical rules establishing power, emission, and 
frequency stability limits for DSRCS operations.  However, the Commission has deferred 
consideration of DSRCS licensing and service rules and spectrum channelization plans to a later 
proceeding, pending promulgation of standards by the Department of Transportation.
Purpose
The purpose of Part 90, subpart M is to provide a regulatory framework that allows entities to 
effectively deploy radio-based devices and systems to enhance safety of life and protection of 
property on the nation's highways, railways and other transportation corridors, without causing 
harmful interference to other radio services. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
The services provided by LMS operators, such as vehicular tracking, tend to be niche services, 
and competition in these sectors appears to be more limited than in other types of wireless 
services.  In addition, many LMS licensees are state and local government entities rather than 
commercial enterprises.  The number of LMS licensees has increased, however, since the 
Commission completed its auction of multilateration LMS licenses in March 1999.  As these 
licensees begin to deploy services, the level of competition in LMS could increase.  
Advantages
The Part 90, subpart M rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of 
spectrum.  Geographic area licensing of multilateration systems minimizes the administrative 
burden involved in obtaining a license and thus avoids undue delay in the authorization of new 
services to the public.  Minimal technical standards facilitate the introduction of new 
technologies. 
Disadvantages
The Part 90, subpart M rules impose some administrative burdens inherent to the licensing 
process and to compliance with technical and operational rules.  The provisions relating to 
secondary use of the LMS band by Part 15 users and amateur licensees impose some additional 
technical burdens on LMS licensees to avoid and resolve interference between their systems and 
these other uses.  
Recent Efforts
Aside from the DSRCS proceeding discussed above, the Commission has not significantly 
revised the Part 90, subpart M rules since the LMS auction.
Recommendation
In general, the rules in subparts M and X are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum 
management functions performed by the Commission, and the necessity for these rules is not 
significantly affected by changes in competition.  Therefore, the staff concludes that significant 
modification or repeal of the rules is not necessary at this time.  The staff recommends continuing 
to monitor developments in order to determine whether any additional rule modifications are 
necessary to foster competition. 

PART 90, SUBPART P ? PAGING OPERATIONS IN THE 929 MHZ BAND
Description
Part 90 subpart P contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for paging operations in the 
929 MHz Band.  This rule part includes services such as commercial paging and private carrier 
paging (PCP).  Licensees may operate on exclusive channels or designated shared channels on a 
CMRS or PMRS basis.  
In general, the rules in this subpart (1) specify the exclusive channels and shared channels; and 
(2) define technical limits on operation (e.g., antenna height, transmitter power) to prevent 
interference.  For paging operations on exclusive channels, the licensees are subject to Part 22 of 
the Commission's rules regarding the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 90, subpart P rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment and 
use of exclusive or shared channels in the 929 MHz Band and to prevent interference.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
As detailed in the Fifth Competition Report, Part 90 paging providers operate in an environment 
that is marked by significant and increasing competition in mobile telephony, paging/messaging, 
and mobile data.  
Advantages
The Part 90, subpart P rules provide a clear, predictable structure for the assignment and use of 
spectrum.  In Part 90, Subpart P, frequency bands that are licensed on an exclusive basis are 
subject to competitive bidding.  The shared channels are available to all eligible entities. 
Disadvantages
The Part 90, subpart P rules impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent 
to the licensing process and compliance with technical and operational rules.  
Recent Efforts
The Commission has made significant changes to its Part 90, subpart P rules in recent years.  In 
the mid-1990s, the Commission converted the authorization of stations in the 929 MHz Band 
from the original site-by-site procedure to a geographic area licensing process.  The Second 
Report and Order established geographic area licensing for 929 MHz paging and adopted 
competitive bidding procedures.   The Third Report and Order changed the geographic area 
licensing of 929 MHz paging from MTAs to MEAs and clarified that spectrum will automatically 
revert to the geographic area licensee in all instances where a non-geographic area incumbent 
licensee permanently discontinues service, as well as allowing geographic area licensees to 
partition their licenses.   The Commission auctioned geographic licenses for the exclusive 
channels in the 929 MHz band.   Furthermore, the Part 22 Rules regarding paging now apply to 
all 929 MHz licensees on exclusive channels.  More recently, most of the application filing rules 
were moved from this subpart to Part 1 in connection with implementation of electronic filing 
procedures and the Universal Licensing System.
Recommendation
In general, the rules in this part are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for these rules is also not significantly 
affected by changes in the level of competition in wireless services.  Moreover, as noted above, 
the Commission has significantly revised and streamlined the Part 90, subpart P rules and 
consolidated them with the Part 22 rules.  The remaining rules are necessary for the operation and 
interference protection for licensees in the shared channels in the 929 MHz Band.  Therefore, the 
staff concludes that significant modification or repeal of the Part 90, subpart P rules is not 
necessary at this time.

PART 90, SUBPARTS S (REGULATIONS FOR LICENSING AND USE OF FREQUENCIES IN 
THE 800 AND 900 MHZ BANDS), AND U AND V (COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEDURES 
FOR THE 900 AND 800 MHZ SERVICE)
Description
Subpart S  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules the 800 MHz and 900 MHz 
Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) services, as well as non-commercial services above 800 MHz, 
i.e., public safety services and services that are used by utilities, transportation companies, and 
other businesses for internal purposes.  Prior to the passage of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),  all of these services were described as "private land 
mobile radio services" or "PLMRS," and were classified as private, i.e., non-common carrier, 
services.  With the passage of OBRA, however, Congress reclassified 800 MHz and 900 MHz 
SMR services as commercial mobile radio services or "CMRS," and required all CMRS providers 
to be regulated as common carriers.   The regulatory status of non-CMRS Part 90 services was 
not affected by OBRA, and these services continue to be classified as private land mobile radio 
services. 
In general, the rules in Subpart S: (1) specify the frequency bands in which each service operates; 
(2) define the service area of licenses in each frequency band; (3) establish minimum construction 
or coverage requirements for licensees; and (4) define technical limits on operation (e.g., antenna 
height, transmitter power) to prevent interference.  
Subparts U and V  contain competitive bidding rules and procedures for 900 MHz SMR and 
800 MHz SMR services, respectively.  The rules in these subparts: (1) identify the licenses to be 
sold by competitive bidding; (2) establish the competitive bidding mechanisms to be used in 900 
and 800 MHz SMR auctions; (3) establish application, disclosure and certification procedures for 
short- and long-form applications; (4) specify down payment, withdrawal, and default 
mechanisms; (5) provide definitions of gross revenues for designated entities and specify the 
bidding credits for which designated entities qualify; and (6) provide eligibility and technical 
requirements for partitioning and disaggregation.
The original Subpart S rules for were adopted by the Commission in 1982, and provided for site-
based licensing of 800 and 900 MHz channels.   Following the passage of OBRA,  the 
Commission initiated rulemakings to use geographic licensing and auctions in the 800 MHz and 
900 MHz services.  In PR Docket 89-553, the Commission revised Subpart S to provide for 
geographic licensing of the 900 MHz SMR service, and replaced the previous site-based licensing 
rules with competitive bidding rules by adding Subpart U to Part 90.   In PR Docket No. 93-144, 
the Commission adopted geographic licensing rules for 800 MHz SMR, and adopted the 
competitive bidding rules in Subpart V.   In both services, the Commission grandfathered all 
previously granted site-based SMR licenses.  Consequently, many of the Subpart S rules 
governing operation by site-based SMR licensees remain in effect as to these grandfathered 
licensees.  In 1997, the Commission conducted the 900 MHz auction and awarded geographic 
area licenses.  Geographic licensing of 800 MHz licensing has been divided into phases.  The 800 
MHz upper band auction was held in December 1997; the 800 MHz lower band and General 
Category auctions are scheduled for later this year.  
Purpose
The purpose of the Subpart S rules is to establish basic ground rules for the assignment of 
spectrum to the affected SMR licensees, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to 
prevent interference.  The competitive bidding rules of Subparts U and V help to ensure access to 
new telecommunications offerings by ensuring that market forces guide the allocation of licenses 
so that all customer segments are served with the greatest economic efficiency.  Additionally, the 
designated entity provisions of the competitive bidding rules are intended to provide opportunities 
for small businesses to participate in the provision of telecommunications services. 
Analysis
Status of Competition
As detailed in the Fifth Competition Report, Part 90 SMR providers operate in an environment 
that is marked by significant and increasing competition in mobile telephony, paging/messaging, 
and mobile data.  Some of the larger SMR carriers, particularly Nextel and Southern, provide 
digital wide-area voice services that compete with cellular and PCS.  Other SMR carriers provide 
more traditional dispatch service on a local or regional basis.  Although SMR channels have been 
used primarily for voice communications, systems are also being developed to carry data and 
facsimile services.  Additionally, new digital SMR technology is leading to the development of 
new features and services, such as two-way acknowledgment paging, teleconferencing, and 
voicemail. 
Advantages
The Subpart S rules provide a clear and predictable structure for the assignment and use of SMR 
spectrum, and afford substantial flexibility to licensees to choose the type of service they will 
provide based on market demand.  The Subpart U and V auction rules promote efficient licensing 
of SMR spectrum to those entities that value it the most. 
Disadvantages
There continue to be differences between the licensing, technical, and operational rules that apply 
to grandfathered site-based SMR licenses and those that apply to geographic area licenses.  This 
multiplicity of rules is potentially burdensome to SMR licensees who have both geographic and 
site-based systems, which may result in inconsistent regulatory obligations (e.g., buildout 
requirements) for different portions of their systems.  
Recent Efforts
In the past year, the Commission has reconsidered and revised some of its 800 MHz SMR rules in 
anticipation of the SMR lower band and General Category auctions.   The Commission has also 
given incumbent SMR licensees with wide-area systems the option of applying the same buildout 
and coverage requirements as geographic licensees, thus giving these incumbents greater 
flexibility and parity with geographic licensees.  
Recommendation
In general, the rules in Subpart S are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  Additionally, the need for these rules is not 
significantly affected by changes in the level of competition in wireless services.  However, there 
are several rule sections that contain outdated or burdensome requirements.  For example, the 
staff recommends that the Commission consider eliminating section 90.655,  which requires 
individual end user licensing of SMR facilities that require Federal Aviation Administration 
clearance, have a significant environmental effect, or are located in a radio frequency "quiet 
zone."  The staff recommends that similar consideration be given to removing the requirement 
that site-based SMR licensees provide loading data in order to renew their licenses.   We also 
recommend removal of section 90.607(a),  which requires SMR applicants to provide a 
statement describing the applicant's "planned mode of operation."  Such a requirement appears to 
serve no regulatory purpose, and is inconsistent with the Commission's policies regarding 
flexible use of spectrum.  

PART 90, SUBPARTS T (REGULATIONS FOR LICENSING AND USE OF FREQUENCIES IN 
THE 220-222 MHZ BAND) AND W (COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEDURES FOR THE 220 
MHZ SERVICE)
Description
Part 90, subpart T  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the 220-222 MHz 
(220 MHz) service.  In general, the rules in this part: (1) define the service area of 220 MHz 
licenses; (2) specify the permissible operations for authorized systems; (3) specify the frequencies 
available to 220 MHz licensees; (4) establish license terms; (5) establish the minimum 
construction or coverage requirements for 220 MHz licensees; and (6) define technical limits on 
operation (e.g., antenna height, field strength) to prevent interference.
Part 90, subpart W  contains competitive bidding rules and procedures for commercial licenses 
in the 220 MHz service.  The rules in this subpart: (1) specify which 220 MHz licenses are 
eligible for competitive bidding; (2) establish the competitive bidding mechanisms to be used in 
220 MHz auctions; (3) establish application, disclosure and certification procedures for short- and 
long-form applications; and (4) specify down payment, withdrawal, and default mechanisms.  
The original Subpart T rules for the 220 MHz service were adopted by the Commission in 
1991.   The Commission intended the 220 MHz band to be used for the development of new 
spectrally efficient technologies that would support provision of two-way narrowband services, 
including mobile voice, dispatch, and messaging.  In order to stimulate greater spectral efficiency 
in the band, the Commission adopted a band plan for the 220 MHz service based on 5 kHz 
channels, a narrower bandwidth than was generally used in other private land mobile services.  
As originally designed, the band plan provided for site-based licensing of 220 MHz channels.  
Between 1991 and 1993, the Commission awarded approximately 3,800 site-based licenses, as 
well as a small number of nationwide licenses, using lotteries to select from among mutually 
exclusive applicants (referred to as "Phase I" licensing).  However, the Commission discontinued 
licensing under this approach due to the large volume of applications received, concerns 
regarding possible speculation in applications, and judicial challenges to the Phase I licensing 
procedures.  
In 1993, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which conferred authority on 
the Commission to award licenses by competitive bidding.   Based on its new authority, the 
Commission sought to develop new licensing rules for 220 MHz spectrum that was not licensed 
in Phase I.  In 1997, the Commission adopted "Phase II" licensing rules, substantially revising 
Subpart T to provide for licensing based on regional and nationwide geographic areas rather than 
site-specific licenses.   The Commission also replaced the previous lottery-based licensing rules 
with competitive bidding rules by adding Subpart W to Part 90.  As part of the conversion to 
geographic licensing and auctions, the Commission grandfathered all previously granted Phase I 
licenses.  Consequently, the Subpart T rules governing operation by site-based 220 MHz 
licensees remain in effect as to these grandfathered licensees.  In September-October 1998 and 
June 1999, the Commission conducted Phase II auctions of 220 MHz spectrum pursuant to the 
rules and procedures set forth in Subpart W.  
Purpose
The purpose of the Subparts T and W rules is to facilitate the assignment of spectrum in the 220-
222 MHz service, to ensure efficient spectrum use by licensees, and to prevent interference 
through establishment of technical limits on operation (e.g., siting requirements and limits on 
transmitter power).  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Licensees in the 220 MHz service are permitted to provide voice, data, paging, and fixed 
communications.  Because of the limited amount of spectrum in the 220 MHz band, most 
licensees offer narrowband services that are not spectrum-intensive.  Trunked dispatch has 
become a particularly prevalent application, particularly as the 800/900 MHz SMR bands are 
used increasingly for mobile telephony.  Since the award of Phase II licenses in 1998 and 1999, 
many 220 MHz licensees have begun to deploy their networks, and dispatch subscribership in the 
220 MHz band grew 35 percent in 1999.   Suppliers of 220 MHz equipment anticipate that there 
will be increased buildout and demand for service in the next several years.   Thus, there is 
potential for the 220 MHz service to be increasingly competitive and to contribute to inter-service 
CMRS competition. 
Advantages
The Subpart T rules, particularly the rules applicable to Phase II geographic licensees, provide a 
clear and predictable structure for the assignment and use of 220-222 MHz band spectrum, and 
afford substantial flexibility to licensees to choose the type of service they will provide based on 
market demand.  The Subpart W auction rules promote efficient licensing of 220 MHz spectrum 
to those entities that value it the most.
Disadvantages
Although the Commission has recently simplified and streamlined the 220 MHz rules in many 
respects (see below), there continue to be differences among the licensing, technical, and 
operational rules that apply to grandfathered Phase I site-based licenses and those that apply to 
Phase II geographic area licenses.  This multiplicity of rules is potentially burdensome to 220 
MHz licensees who have systems comprised of both Phase I and Phase II licenses, which may 
result in inconsistent regulatory obligations (e.g., buildout requirements) for different portions of 
their systems. 
Recent Efforts
In several recent orders, the Commission has taken steps to reduce regulatory burdens and afford 
greater flexibility to 220 MHz licensees.  For example, the original 220 MHz rules required 
licensees to provide two-way land mobile service on a primary basis, and allowed use of the band 
for fixed services or for paging only on an "ancillary" basis.  In the 220 MHz Third Report and 
Order, the Commission eliminated the ancillary use limitation, thus allowing licensees to provide 
any or all of these services on a co-primary basis.    The Commission has also adopted rules 
permitting partitioning and disaggregation of 220 MHz licenses, and has eliminated the "40-mile 
rule" that previously limited the number of Phase I licenses that an individual licensee could hold 
in a given geographic area.   Finally, the Commission recently eliminated mandatory spectrum 
efficiency standards that had previously been adopted for provision of voice and data over 220 
MHz systems that combined contiguous 5 kHz channels.   The Commission concluded that 
mandating technical standards was unnecessary because market forces would spur efficient 
spectrum use, and that retaining mandatory standards could impair rather than encourage 
technical innovation.  
Recommendation
In general, the rules in Subpart T are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum management 
functions performed by the Commission.  Moreover, as noted above, the Commission has 
significantly revised and streamlined the 220 MHz rules in recent proceedings.  Therefore, the 
staff concludes that substantial modification or repeal of the 220 MHz rules is not necessary at 
this time.  However, the staff recommends that consideration be given to whether certain rules 
applicable to Phase I licensees continue to be necessary.  For example, section 90.737 imposes 
certain reporting requirements and restrictions on assignments of unconstructed Phase I licenses 
that were intended to prevent speculation and trafficking in licenses awarded by lottery.   Now 
that licensing by lottery has been discontinued, however, these rules may actually impede the 
transferability of 220 MHz spectrum.  The staff therefore recommends that consideration be given 
to eliminating these rules.  
Similarly, as noted elsewhere in this Staff Report, the Commission has consolidated its 
competitive bidding rules in Part 1, with the goal of having future auctions be conducted in 
accordance with Part 1 rules.  Therefore, to the extent that future auctions are necessary in the 
220 MHz service, they will be governed by Part 1, and the continued presence of separate 220 
MHz auction rules in Subpart W appears to be redundant.  The staff recommends that 
consideration be given to eliminating these rules.  

PART 95 - PERSONAL RADIO SERVICES, SUBPART F - 218-219 MHZ SERVICE
Description
Part 95  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the Personal Radio Services, a 
collection of wireless services that are generally used by individuals for personal communications 
and to support the radio needs of their activities and interests.  These services include the General 
Mobile Radio Service (Subpart A), the Family Radio Service (Subpart B), the Radio Control 
(R/C) Radio Service (Subpart C), and the Citizens Band (CB) Radio Service (Subpart D).  The 
Personal Radio Services also include the Low Power Radio Service (Subpart G) and the Wireless 
Medical Telemetry Service (Subpart H), which are used to support auditory assistance and 
medical applications. 
For purposes of the Biennial Regulatory Review, the analysis of Part 95 in this report focuses on 
the 218-219 MHz Service (Subpart F), which is unique among the Personal Radio Services in that 
it may be used for commercial applications, it is licensed on a geographic exclusive-use basis, 
and its licensure is subject to the Commission's competitive bidding procedures.  
Part 95, subpart F was originally created to support the Interactive Video and Data Service  
(IVDS), a short-distance communications service by which licensees could provide information, 
products, or services to, and allow interactive responses from, subscribers within the licensee's 
service area.  In 1998, the Commission renamed IVDS the 218-219 MHz Service and revised 
Subpart F to allow 218-219 MHz licensees greater flexibility to identify and structure services in 
response to market demand.  Under the current service rules, both common carrier and private 
operations are permitted, and both one- and two-way communications are allowed. 
The licensing and technical rules for the 218-219 MHz Service are contained in Subpart F, 
although certain rules that are broadly applicable to all wireless telecommunications services 
(including the 218-219 MHz Service) have been consolidated in Part 1. 
Purpose
Part 95, subpart F contains the licensing and technical rules for the administration of a radio 
service in the 218-219 MHz band.  The rules are intended to provide licensees with the maximum 
flexibility to structure their services while protecting over-the-air television reception of TV 
Channel 13.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The original IVDS service was generally not commercially successful, and little or no 
competition emerged to use the 218-219 MHz band to provide interactive television applications.  
Under the revised service rules, 218-219 MHz Service licensees have proposed wireless data 
applications such as meter reading and vehicle tracking services.  Accordingly, the expectation is 
that the 218-219 MHz Service could soon provide sources of competition for other wireless 
services.  However, this competition is developing slowly, due in part to (1) the limited 
permissible use of the service before its recent restructuring; (2) the fact that many 218-219 MHz 
Service markets are not currently licensed due to payment defaults; and (3) the on-going 
implementation of the service restructuring. 
Advantages
The Part 95, subpart F rules provide licensees with the flexibility to identify and implement 
services in response to market demand.  Licensees no longer have to operate within the context of 
rules designed to support a specific application - interactive television - and instead enjoy a freer 
hand in structuring service under their licenses.  For example, technical rules that mandated 
specific antenna height-power ratios have been replaced with general interference protection 
requirements, and rigid construction benchmarks have been replaced with a "substantial service" 
requirement that is more suitable to niche services that may develop in the 218-219 MHz Service. 
Disadvantages
There are no significant disadvantages to the Subpart F rules at this time, although the rules do 
impose limited administrative and technical burdens that are inherent to the licensing process and 
that are necessary for compliance with technical and operational rules.  As more licensees begin 
providing service and we gain more experience in the administration of the 218-219 MHz 
Service, we will continue to examine whether any of these rules impose unnecessary burdens and 
costs and could therefore be candidates for additional streamlining.
Recent Efforts
The Commission has made significant changes to its Part 95, subpart F rules in recent years.  As 
noted above, the Commission renamed the service and revised the rules in 1998 to afford more 
flexibility to licensees over use of the spectrum.  The Commission adopted additional sweeping 
changes to the 218-219 MHz service in September 1999.   The Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau is still implementing these changes, and several petitions for reconsideration remain 
pending in the docket.  In addition, the 218-219 MHz Service has been affected by a number of 
broadly applicable rulemaking actions, such as the Universal Licensing System (ULS) proceeding 
that was initiated in conjunction with the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review.
Recommendation
Due to the recent comprehensive evaluation and restructuring of the 218-219 MHz Service, no 
changes are recommended to this subpart at this time.  The rules that were retained in the 1999 
restructuring are an integral part of the basic licensing and spectrum management functions 
performed by the Commission and should be retained.  Although there is presently only limited 
competition within the 218-219 MHz Service, this fact is primarily attributable to the narrow 
focus of the former rules that supported interactive television applications and the uncertainty 
surrounding the restructuring of the service.  The staff anticipates the provision of competitive 
services within the 218-219 MHz Service, and will continue to monitor developments in order to 
determine whether any additional rule modifications are necessary to foster competition. 

PART 100 - DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE SERVICE
Description
Part 100 was issued pursuant to the provisions of Title III of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, which gives the Federal Communications Commission authority to regulate radio 
transmissions and to issue licenses for radio stations.  Part 100 sets forth rules applicable to the 
Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS), including public interest obligations, general licensing 
and application filing requirements, technical and operating requirements, and competitive 
bidding procedures.

Part 100 is organized into five sub-parts:
A- General Information
B- Administrative Procedures
C- Technical Requirements
D-Operating Requirements
E- Competitive Bidding Procedures for DBS

Purpose
Part 100 provides rules under which the International Bureau licenses DBS systems.  The rules 
are designed to promote fair competition in the multi-channel video programming distribution 
market.  Sections of Part 100 also have provisions:  (1) to assure protection from impermissible 
levels of interference; (2) to assure compliance with international regulations; (3) to assure the 
timely construction and operation of authorized space stations; (4) to assure the timely provision 
of sufficient information to allow for processing of applications; (5) to assure compliance with 
license specifications and conditions, as well as with Commission rules and regulations; and (6) 
to provide competitive bidding procedures for the provision of DBS services.
Analysis
Status of Competition
The DBS service competes with other multi-channel video program distribution services (e.g., 
cable).  Today there are two major providers of DBS.  The service as a whole, and the individual 
companies are growing rapidly in subscribership and have the capital to offer new digital 
technologies to consumers.  Additionally, the Commission has permitted mergers in the DBS 
industry that have placed the two DBS licensees in a stronger position to compete with other 
suppliers of multi-channel video program distribution services (e.g., cable TV systems, which are 
still today the dominant suppliers of multi-channel video program distribution services).  
Furthermore, the U.S. has entered into agreements with Mexico and Argentina, which allow those 
countries to provide Direct-to-Home services (similar to DBS) into the U.S.  Finally, we 
anticipate auctioning additional DBS orbital slots that are allotted to the U.S. which will provide 
existing or new DBS providers the opportunity to further expand the service to U.S. consumers.
Advantages
Subpart A- General Information: This subpart includes the basis and purpose of this rule subpart.  
Specifically, it sets forth the Commission's statutory authority to regulate DBS, which fosters 
efficient spectrum use.  This subpart increases consumer choice and diversity in programming, as 
well as imposes political advertising rules on DBS providers.
Subpart B- Administrative Procedures: This subpart describes the eligibility criterion for DBS 
authorizations, including foreign ownership restrictions.  It provides clear procedures for filing 
applications and procedures for evaluating whether applications are complete.  This allows for 
efficient use of resources and ensures compliance with the Commission's rules. 
Subpart C-Technical Requirements: This subpart provides technical standards and operating 
rules to minimize interference among DBS licensees.
Subpart D- Operating Requirements: Section 100.51 describes the Equal Employment 
Opportunities policy for DBS.  This section promotes diversity in employment and creates 
expanded opportunities to provide service.  Section 100.53 sets out geographic service rules for 
DBS providers.  This ensures delivery of service to the public. 
Subpart E- Competitive Bidding Procedures for DBS: This subpart describes the mechanism for 
competitive bidding for satellite DBS service.  Competitive bidding awards DBS licenses to those 
firms that will most efficiently use orbital resources to compete in providing service.  Further, it 
fosters efficient use of spectrum and the development of a competitive DBS market.  
Disadvantages
Subpart A- General Information: Section 100.5 (DBS public interest obligations) may increase a 
licensees operating administrative and compliance costs.  Further, this section may restrict the 
alternative uses of the resources that must now be set aside for public interest programming.
Subpart B- Administrative Procedures: This subpart could increase a licensee's administrative 
costs and hamper the introduction of new services.  For example, if the milestone schedule for 
construction and operation of DBS systems is too long, it may result in the deployment of 
inefficient technologies.  In the alternative, if the schedule is too short, it may result in a loss of a 
license if build out is delayed because of unforeseen technical problems.
Subpart C- Technical Requirements: These standards and operating rules, while preserving the 
operating environment today, could hamper the introduction of new services and restrict 
alternative uses of resources in the future.
Subpart D-Operating Requirements: Rules in this section might increase operating costs and limit 
potential use of resources.
Subpart E- Competitive Bidding Procedures for DBS: Satellite services in the planned frequency 
bands require international coordination prior to the commencement of operations (e.g., when the 
plans are modified to accommodate new services).  The value of the orbital location resource is 
uncertain if the international coordination process has not yet been completed.
Recent Efforts
As described in the staff report, the Commission has taken steps to streamline the regulation of 
DBS.  The Commission issued an Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which seeks comment on its 
proposals to streamline the DBS rules by integrating the Part 100 DBS service rules into Part 25 
(Satellite Communications), by eliminating duplicative rule sections, and by consolidating 
existing rule sections as appropriate. 
Recommendation
Consistent with the outstanding Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the staff recommends that all of 
the DBS rules contained in Part 100 be retained.  It is anticipated that the entire Part 100 will be 
incorporated into Part 25 and Part 100 will be eliminated as a result of the outstanding 
proceeding.

PART 101 - FIXED MICROWAVE SERVICES
Description
Part 101  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the microwave services.  Fixed 
microwave spectrum is primarily used to deliver video, audio, data, and control functions for 
other specific communications services from one point and/or hub to other points and/or 
subscribers for distribution.  Most Part 101 application processing rules, technical standards, and 
operational requirements apply to all Part 101 services, but others apply only to specific 
services,  or to common carrier services but not private services (or vice versa). 
Part 101 was created in 1996 through consolidation of the rules for the common carrier and 
private operational fixed (POFS) microwave services contained in Parts 21 and 94. 
Part 101 contains 14 lettered subparts:  
	A - General
	B - Applications and Licenses
	C - Technical Standards
	D - Operational Requirements
	E - Miscellaneous Common Carrier Provisions
	F - Developmental Authorizations
	G - 24 GHz Services and Digital Electronic Message Service
	H - Private Operational Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave Service
	I - Common Carrier Fixed Point-to-Point Microwave Service
	J - Local Television Transmission Service
	K - [Reserved]
	L - Local Multipoint Distribution Service
	M - Competitive Bidding Procedures for LMDS
N - Competitive Bidding Procedures for the 38.6-40.0 GHz Band

Purpose
Part 101 sets forth application processing procedures, technical standards, and operational 
requirements for the microwave services.  The Commission created the Part 101 rules to reduce 
or eliminate the differences in processing applications between common carriers and private 
operational fixed microwave service licensees, and to further the regulatory parity among these 
microwave services.   
Analysis
Status of Competition
Because the Part 101 microwave services encompass a variety of private and common carrier 
applications, and because some services are licensed on a point-to-point basis while others are 
licensed geographically, the level of competition varies greatly among individual microwave 
services. 
The largest commercial deployment of Part101 microwave services has occurred in the 24 GHz 
(DEMS), 28 GHz (LMDS), and 39 GHz bands.  The most significant operators in these bands, 
Teligent, Inc. (Teligent) and WinStar Communications, Inc. (WinStar), are currently 
concentrating on business customers.  These operators are either now offering or are planning in 
the future to offer subscribers a variety of one- and two-way broadband services, such as video 
programming distribution, wireless local loop telephony, Internet access and other high speed 
data transmission services.  Thus, if successful, licensees in these bands have the potential to 
create facilities-based competition in numerous industries, including high-speed broadband 
services.  In other Part 101 services, licensees continue to rely on traditional point-to-point 
microwave systems to meet their operational support and critical infrastructure needs as opposed 
to using microwave technologies to directly access customers. 
Advantages
The Part 101 rules provide for a unified regulatory approach for the microwave services, and 
eliminate the differences in processing applications between common carriers and POFS 
licensees that existed in the former rules.  The Part 101 rules were adopted at the same time the 
microwave industry was developing new collaboration and coordination agreements, and took 
into consideration the industry's expressed desire to have common carrier and POFS microwave 
services treated in the same fashion when appropriate.   Because each of the microwave services 
share at least some frequencies with other microwave services, and because some frequencies are 
shared with government users, the rules minimize repetition, reduce the potential for interference, 
and aid different microwave users in efficient use of the microwave spectrum.
Part 101 also contains competitive bidding rules (Subparts M and N) that, in conjunction with our 
spectrum allocation rules, promote economic growth and enhance access to telecommunications 
service offerings for consumers, producers, and new entrants.  The competitive bidding rules are 
structured to promote opportunity and competition.  This has resulted in the rapid implementation 
of new and innovative services and the efficient use of spectrum use, thereby fostering economic 
growth.  In contrast to lotteries and comparative hearings, auctions are faster, more efficient, and 
more likely to get spectrum to entities that value it the most.  Through these rules, the 
Commission has recovered a portion of the value of the public spectrum.  
Disadvantages
Because the Part 101 rules represent a relatively new consolidation of Parts 21 and 74, licensees 
and applicants have identified certain rules that are ambiguous or confusing, and certain technical 
characteristics - including those relating to frequency tolerance, spectrum efficiency, and antenna 
standards - that could be modified.   In addition, some rules could  be candidates for further 
consolidation or streamlining.   For example, the current rules do not allow shared use among 
providers and between POFS and common carrier licensees. 
Recent Efforts
The Commission is in the midst of a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Part 101 rules.   The 
Part 101 NPRM, which was released on February 14, 2000, proposes to eliminate rules that are 
duplicative, outmoded, or otherwise unnecessary; it also seeks comment on specific proposals to 
"examine the[] rules and procedures and offer their view and explanations of ways to streamline 
them and to make sure that the regulations conform with the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended."   The pleading cycle for the Part 101 NPRM closed August 4, 2000. 
The Commission has made significant changes to the competitive bidding rules of Part 1, subpart 
Q.  In the Part 1 Third Report and Order,  the Commission made substantive amendments and 
modifications to the competitive bidding rules for all auctionable services.  These changes to the 
competitive bidding rules are intended to streamline regulations and eliminate unnecessary rules 
wherever possible, increase the efficiency of the competitive bidding process, and provide more 
specific guidance to auction participants.  The changes also advance our auction program by 
reducing the burden on the Commission and the public of conducting service-by-service auction 
rule makings, such as those rule makings that created the competitive bidding rules of Subparts M 
and N.  
Recommendation
Because of the ongoing rulemaking embodied in the Part 101 NPRM, staff does not recommend 
that any additional changes be made to the rules within the context of the biennial regulatory 
review.  Indeed, the pending rulemaking engages in the same type of comprehensive examination 
of our service and technical rules that we are undertaking as part of the larger biennial regulatory 
review process.
In general, the competitive bidding rules in this subpart are integral to the basic licensing and 
spectrum management functions performed by the Commission.  The necessity for these rules is 
also not significantly affected by changes in the level of competition in the auctionable services.  
In addition, the Commission has significantly revised and streamlined the competitive bidding 
rules in this subpart in several proceedings.  Therefore, the staff concludes that significant 
modification or repeal of the Part 101 competitive bidding rules is not necessary at this time.  
However, to the extent that service-specific auction rules are duplicative of the consolidated 
auction rules in Part 1, the staff recommends that they be modified or eliminated.  

PART 101, SUBPART G - 24 GHZ SERVICE AND DIGITAL ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SERVICE
Description
Part 101 contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for fixed operational microwave 
services that require operating facilities on land or in certain offshore coastal areas.  This report 
focuses on subpart G, which contains rules for the 24 GHz Service and the Digital Electronic 
Message Service (DEMS).  DEMS systems are common carrier point-to-multipoint microwave 
networks designed to communicate information between a fixed (nodal) station and a multiple 
fixed user terminals,  and this subpart was originally intended to accommodate operation of 
high-speed, two-way, point-to-multipoint terrestrial microwave transmission systems. 
DEMS was originally licensed for use in the 18.82-18.92 GHz and 19.16-19.26 GHz bands.  It 
was subsequently reallocated to the 24.25-24.45 GHz and 25/05-25.25 GHz bands. 
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 101 subpart G rules is to establish the rules for allocation and use of 
wireless services at 24 GHz (including DEMS), to ensure efficient spectrum use, and to prevent 
interference.  
Analysis
Status of Competition
Under the original DEMS grants in the 1980s, the service was not initially commercially 
successful.   In the early 1990s, a small number of companies began acquiring licenses in 
approximately thirty of the nation's largest markets.   The majority of licenses are currently held 
by Teligent.  The 24 GHz spectrum used by DEMS has been identified as a potential competitor 
in the local exchange telephone market.   Teligent, which recently completed its initial plan to 
roll out service in 40 U.S. markets, provides a bundle of broadband fixed wireless 
telecommunication services to small- and medium-sized businesses. 
Advantages
The current rules provide a clear regulatory framework for the development of competitive fixed 
wireless services.  The existing technical and operational rules are necessary for administration of 
a radio service at 24 GHz.
Disadvantages
The current subpart G rules were written when the primary use of DEMS was expected to be by 
businesses requiring internal networks to distribute documents, share data, and hold 
teleconferences.  Accordingly, some of the terminology reflects this initial service concept.  
Mobile service is not permitted in the 24 GHz band.
Recent Efforts
In 1999, the Commission initiated a rulemaking proceeding (WT Docket No. 99-327) in which it 
undertook a comprehensive review of use of the 24 GHz band.  In a Report and Order adopted 
July 25, 2000, the Commission revised Part 101 subpart G to comprehensively regulate 
operations within the 24 GHz band.  Under the newly adopted changes, the Commission will 
license the 24 GHz band in 40 MHz channel pairs, provide 24 GHz band licensees more 
flexibility in system design, implement a ten-year license term and a "substantial service" 
requirement at renewal, allow 24 GHz band licensees to partition and/or disaggregate their 
licenses, and introduce flexible technical standards.  Existing DEMS licensees are treated as 
incumbent licensees subject to the new 24 GHz rules.
Recommendation
In light of the Commission's comprehensive review of its 24 GHz rules in WT Docket No. 99-
327, the staff concludes that issues pertaining to Subpart G are being adequately addressed in that 
proceeding.  

PART 101, SUBPARTS L (LOCAL MULTIPOINT DISTRIBUTION SERVICE (LMDS)) AND M 
(COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCEDURES FOR LMDS)
Description
Part 101  contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for the fixed microwave radio 
services.  Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) systems are fixed point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint radio systems that consist of hub and subscriber stations.  LMDS licensees 
may provide a variety of services, including high-speed data and Internet services and multi-
channel video programming distribution.   
Subpart L contains licensing, technical, and operational rules for LMDS.  In general, the rules in 
this part: (1) provide eligibility restrictions in this service; (2)  define the service area of LMDS 
licenses; (3) specify the permissible operations for authorized systems; (3) specify the frequencies 
available to LMDS licensees; (4) establish license terms; (5) establish the minimum construction 
or coverage requirements for LMDS licensees; and (6) define system operations and permissible 
communication services.
Subpart M contains competitive bidding rules and procedures for commercial licenses in LMDS.  
In particular, the rules, on a service-specific basis: (1) provide competitive bidding mechanisms 
and design options; (2) establish application, disclosure and certification procedures for short- 
and long-form applications; (3) specify down payment, unjust enrichment, withdrawal and default 
mechanisms; (4) provide definitions of gross revenues for designated entities and specify the 
bidding credits for which designated entities qualify; and (5) provide eligibility and technical 
requirements for partitioning and disaggregation. 
Purpose
The purpose of the Part 101 rules is to establish basic ground rules for assignment of spectrum for 
private operational, common carrier, and LMDS fixed microwave operations that require 
operating facilities on land or in specified offshore coastal areas.  Subpart L contains the basic 
licensing and operational rules for LMDS.  Subpart M helps to ensure access to new 
telecommunications offerings by ensuring that all customer segments are served, that there is not 
an excessive concentration of licenses, and that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and 
businesses owned by women and minorities will have genuine opportunities to participate in the 
provision of service.
Analysis
Status of Competition
LMDS is a "nascent market."   The initial LMDS operator, Cellularvision, no longer provides 
multi-channel video programming distribution services, and has announced plans to offer high-
speed data access on a portion of its original spectrum.  The remaining licenses were issued by 
auctions held in March 1998 and April and May 1999.  Accordingly, LMDS equipment is still 
subject to limited availability and the majority of licensees are still developing their systems.   
LMDS will most likely compete with wireless and wireline broadband service providers targeting 
small and medium businesses. 
Advantages
The Subpart L rules provide licensees with broad flexibility to identify and implement services in 
response to market demand.  The Commission recently allowed LMDS eligibility restrictions for 
incumbent local exchange carrier and cable companies to sunset;  this development should 
provide access to additional capital to develop LMDS fully, make administration of LMDS 
consistent with other competitive services, and aid the development of LMDS in rural markets. 
The Subpart M competitive bidding rules, in conjunction with our spectrum allocation rules, 
promote economic growth and enhance access to telecommunications service offerings for 
consumers, producers, and new entrants.  The competitive bidding rules of Subpart M were 
structured to promote opportunity and competition.  This has resulted in the rapid implementation 
of new and innovative services and the efficient use of spectrum use, thereby fostering economic 
growth.  In contrast to lotteries and comparative hearings, auctions are faster, more efficient, and 
more likely to get spectrum to entities that value it the most.  Through these rules, the 
Commission has recovered a portion of the value of the public spectrum.  
Disadvantages
There are no discernable disadvantages to the LMDS rules.  The existing rules consist of 
technical and operational rules that are necessary for administration of the service.
The Subpart M competitive bidding rules have no significant disadvantages.  Nevertheless, the 
rules impose higher transaction costs to auction participants.  For example, auction transaction 
costs are higher than the transaction costs for lotteries.  In addition, because the need remains for 
service-specific notice and comment proceedings prior to the auction event, there is some delay in 
licensing.  These delays, however, are far less than other licensing mechanisms.
Recent Efforts
The June 23, 2000, LMDS Third R&O allowed the cross-ownership restriction that prohibited 
incumbent local exchange carriers and cable companies from having an attributable interest in the 
LMDS A block license that overlaps with ten percent or more of the population in their service 
areas to expire on June 30.  The decision to allow the cross-ownership rule to sunset was based on 
a thorough analysis of competitive issues and the LMDS market.
The Commission has made significant changes to the competitive bidding rules of Part 1 Subpart 
Q.  In the Part 1 Third Report and Order,  the Commission made substantive amendments and 
modifications to the competitive bidding rules for all auctionable services.  These changes to the 
competitive bidding rules are intended to streamline regulations and eliminate unnecessary rules 
wherever possible, increase the efficiency of the competitive bidding process, and provide more 
specific guidance to auction participants.  The changes also advance our auction program by 
reducing the burden on the Commission and the public of conducting service-by-service auction 
rule makings, such as those rule makings that created the competitive bidding rules of Subpart M.  
Recommendation
The staff recommends that no substantive changes be made to this subpart at this time.  Certain 
nonsubstantive revisions could be made to the LMDS rules for the purposes of simplification and 
to provide clarity to licensees and applicants.   The staff also concludes that substantive 
modification of the Subpart M competitive bidding rules is not necessary at this time.  In general, 
the competitive bidding rules in this subpart are integral to the basic licensing and spectrum 
management functions performed by the Commission in LMDS.  However, the Commission has 
consolidated its competitive bidding rules in Part 1, with the goal of having future auctions be 
conducted in accordance with Part 1 rules.  Therefore, to the extent that future auctions are 
necessary in LMDS, the staff recommends that they be governed by Part 1, and that consideration 
be given to eliminating or phasing out the separate rules in this subpart to the extent they are 
redundant.

 	The Commission's rules define CPE as equipment employed on the premises of a person other than a 
carrier to originate, route or terminate telecommunications.  47 C.F.R. 153(14).
 	The Commission's Part 68 rules are designed to ensure that equipment directly connected to the public 
switched network will not: (1) result in electrical hazards to telephone company personnel; (2) damage 
telephone company equipment; (3) cause the malfunction of telephone company billing equipment; or  (4) 
degrade service to persons other than the user of the equipment involved, persons the equipment user calls, 
or those who call the user.  47 C.F.R.  68.3.  Equipment manufacturers are not required to comply with the 
technical standards in Part 68, but CPE that is not certified as meeting these standards cannot be directly 
connected to the public switched network, and has limited marketability.  The U.S.Customs Service also 
prohibits the importation of terminal equipment that is not registered pursuant to Part 68.  See  19 U.S.C.  
3109.
 	CPE can now be certified as complying with the Part 68 requirements by private Telecommunications 
Certification Bodies as well as the Commission.  47 C.F.R.  160.

considered to be mutually exclusive. See Ashbacker v. FCC, 326 U.S. 327 (1945).  Under Ashbacker, 
where such mutual exclusivity exists, the Commission must conduct a hearing to resolve the conflicting 
requests.
 	47 C.F.R.  25.141.  The Commission reallocated radio-determination satellite service (RDSS) 
spectrum to the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).  Therefore, it appears that the RDSS rules in section

 	We have previously observed that our ownership rules seek to foster "outlet" and "source" diversity as 
a means of promoting a diversity of viewpoints.  In the Matter of Review of the Commission's Regulations 
Governing Television Broadcasting, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 10 FCC Rcd 3524, 3549-50, 
 60-61 (1995).  "Outlet" diversity "refers to a variety of delivery services (e.g., broadcast stations) that 
select and present programming directly to the public."  "Source" diversity refers to "a variety of program 
producers and owners."  10 FCC Rcd at 3549-50,  61.  Both outlet and source diversity are "integral to the 
ultimate goal of providing the public with a variety of viewpoints..The Commission has felt that without a 
diversity of outlets, there would be no real viewpoint diversity - if all programming passed through the 
same filter, the material and views presented to the public would not be diverse.  Similarly, the 
Commission has felt that without diversity of sources, the variety of views would necessarily be 
circumscribed."  Id.

United States, 326 U.S. 1, 20 (1945)).
 	This "marketplace of ideas" metaphor was first articulated by Justice Holmes.  See Abrams v. United 
States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting).

 	According to a recent survey, almost 70 percent of adults said they get most of their news from 
television - almost twice the number that list newspapers as their main news source.  See "America's 
Watching," March/April, 1997, Roper Starch Worldwide, Inc.
 	Congress promotes diversity separate and apart from competition.  For example, Section 202(b) of the 
1996 Act, which set forth new ownership limitations, is titled "Local Radio Diversity." Pub. Law No. 104-
104, 110 Stat. 56, 110 (1996) (emphasis added).  Moreover, in discussing the radio-television cross-
ownership rule, the Conference Report to the 1996 Act noted "the potential for public interest benefits of 
[radio-television station combinations] when bedrock diversity interest[s] are not threatened," and further 
stated that in reviewing this rule the FCC should take into account not only the increased competition 
facing broadcasters but also "the need for diversity in today's radio marketplace."  S. Conf. Rep. 104-230, 
104th Cong. 2d Sess. 163 (1996) (emphasis added).
 	For example, the 1996 Act directs the Commission, in Section 257, in identifying and eliminating 
market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and other small businesses in certain services, "to promote the 
policies and purposes of this Act favoring diversity of media voices."  47 U.S.C.  257(b).  Likewise, the 
Cable Competition and Consumer Protection Act of 1992 sought to "ensure that cable television operators 
do not have undue market power," and "promote the availability to the public of a diversity of views and 
information."  Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Pub. Law No. 102-
385,  2(b) (1992), 106 Stat. 1460.

 	1999 Local Television Ownership Report and Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 12955-57,  119-22.  The five 
factors were:  (1) the potential public service benefits of common ownership of the facilities, such as 
economies of scale, cost savings, and programming benefits; (2) the types of facilities involved; (3) the 
number of media outlets already owned by the applicant in the relevant market; (4) any financial 
difficulties involving the station(s); and (5) issues pertaining to the level of diversity and competition 
within the affected market.
 	Waivers of the new rule will be granted only in situations involving a failed station, as defined in the 
Commission's local television multiple ownership rules.  The waiver applicant must also show that the in-
market buyer is the only entity willing and able to operate the failed station and that the sale to an out-of-
market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price for the station.  1999 Local Television

 	The original General Aviation technology allowed only one operator in each station location. In 1994, 
however, the Commission mandated use of a new technology, Air-Ground Radiotelephone Automated 
Service ("AGRAS"), that, among other improvements, allowed two or more competing ground stations in a 
location to share control channels.
 	Two of the three licensees who failed to construct surrendered their licenses voluntarily, and the third 
license was ultimately canceled by the Commission.

 	The idea of a cellular architecture, that is, a system of base stations, each having a small coverage area, 
which makes possible the reuse of radio channels at relatively short distances, had been conceptualized in 
the 1950s, but did not become technologically feasible until the late 1970s, when advances in computer 
technology needed to manage automatic hand-off of telephone calls between cells were realized.
