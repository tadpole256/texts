                            CSL BULLETIN                            January 1993DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARDThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hasproposed a public key-based Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This CSL Bulletin provides agencies with information regardingthe proposed standard and describes several applications whichmay benefit from the DSS.BackgroundTo reduce costs and increase productivity, many federalgovernment agencies are transforming paper-based systems intoautomated electronic systems.  This trend has brought about aneed for a reliable, cost-effective way to replace a handwrittensignature with a digital signature.  Like a handwrittensignature, a digital signature can be used to identify andauthenticate the originator of the information.  A digitalsignature can also be used to verify that information has notbeen altered after it is signed; this provides message integrity. In August 1991, NIST proposed the DSS as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard (FIPS).  The proposed DSS specifies a DigitalSignature Algorithm (DSA) for use in computing and verifyingdigital signatures.  Overview of Cryptographic Integrity and the DSS  Cryptography can be categorized as either secret key cryptographyor public key cryptography.  Secret key cryptography uses asingle cryptographic key shared by two communicating parties. For secret key cryptography to be effective, the cryptographickey must be kept secret and controlled only by the parties thathave access to the key.  FIPS 46-1, Data Encryption Standard(DES), defines the secret key algorithm to be used by thegovernment for encrypting unclassified federal information.  Using the DES, a cryptographic checksum known as a MessageAuthentication Code (MAC) can be used to provide messageintegrity as specified in FIPS 113, Computer Data Authentication. When a key is shared only between the sender and receiver, theMAC can be used to identify the sender of the information to thereceiver.  However, implementations of this technology cannotinherently be used to prove to a third party that informationactually originated from the sender.  Since both the sender ofthe information and the receiver of the information share thesame key, it is possible that the information could haveoriginated from either party.    Public key cryptography is a form of cryptography which makes useof two keys:  a public key and a private key.  The two keys aremathematically related, but the private key cannot be determinedfrom the public key.  In a system implementing public keytechnology, each party has its own public/private key pair.  Thepublic key can be known by anyone; however, no one should be ableto modify it.  The private key is kept secret.  Its use should becontrolled by its owner and it should be protected againstmodification as well as disclosure.  The proposed DSS defines a public key cryptographic system forgenerating and verifying digital signatures.  The private key israndomly generated.  Using this key and a mathematical processdefined in the standard, the public key is generated.  The DSS isused with the proposed FIPS for a Secure Hash Standard (SHS) togenerate and verify digital signatures.  To generate a signature on a message, the owner of the privatekey first applies the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), as defined inthe proposed SHS, to the message.  This action results in acondensed representation of the message known as a messagedigest.  The owner of the private key then applies the privatekey to the message digest using the mathematical techniquesspecified in the DSA to produce a digital signature.  Any partywith access to the public key, message, and signature can verifythe signature using the DSA.  Public keys are assumed to be knownto the public in general.  If the signature verifies correctly,the receiver (or any other party) has confidence that the messagewas signed by the owner of the public key and the message has notbeen altered after it was signed.  In addition, the verifier can provide the message, digitalsignature, and signer's public key as evidence to a third partythat the message was, in fact, signed by the claimed signer. Given the evidence, the third party can also verify thesignature.  This capability, an inherent benefit of public keycryptography, is called non-repudiation.  The DSS does notprovide confidentiality for information.  If confidentiality isrequired, the signer could first apply the DES to the message andthen sign it using the DSA.  The figure below illustrates atypical use of the DSS.  Applications of Digital SignaturesBecause the DSA authenticates both the identity of the signer andthe integrity of the signed information, it can be used in avariety of applications.  For example, the DSA could be utilizedin an electronic mail system.  After a party generated a message,that party could sign it using the party's private key.  Thesigned message could then be sent to a second party.  Afterverifying the received message, the second party would haveconfidence that the message was signed by the first party.  Thesecond party would also know that the message was not alteredafter the first party signed it. In legal systems, it is often necessary to affix a time stamp toa document in order to indicate the date and time at which thedocument was executed or became effective.  An electronic timestamp could be affixed to documents in electronic form and thensigned using the DSA.  Applying the DSA to the document wouldprotect and verify the integrity of the document and its timestamp. The DSA could also be employed in electronic funds transfersystems.  Suppose an electronic funds transfer message isgenerated to request that $100.00 be transferred from one accountto another.  If the message was passed over an unprotectednetwork, it may be possible for an adversary to alter the messageand request a transfer of $1000.00.  Without additionalinformation, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for thereceiver to know the message had been altered.  However, if theDSA was used to sign the message before it was sent, the receiverwould know the message had been altered because it would notverify correctly.  The transfer request could then be denied.The DSA could be employed in a variety of business applicationsrequiring a replacement of handwritten signatures.  One exampleis Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  EDI is the computer-to-computer interchange of messages representing business documents. In the federal government, this technology is being used toprocure goods and services.  Digital signatures could be used toreplace handwritten signatures in these EDI transactions.  Forinstance, contracts between the government and its vendors couldbe negotiated electronically.  A government procurement officialcould post an electronically signed message requesting bids foroffice supplies.  Vendors wishing to respond to the request mayfirst verify the message before they respond.  This actionassures that the contents of the message have not been alteredand that the request was signed by a legitimate procurementofficial.  After verifying the bid request, the vendor could generate andsign an electronic bid.  Upon receiving the bid, the procurementofficial could verify that the vendor's bid was not altered afterit was signed.  If the bid is accepted, the electronic messagecould be passed to a contracting office to negotiate the finalterms of the contract.  The final contract could be digitallysigned by both the contracting office and the vendor.  If adispute arose at some later time, the contents of the contractand the associated signatures could be verified by a third party.The DSA could also be useful in the distribution of software.  Adigital signature could be applied to software after it has beenvalidated and approved for distribution.  Before installing thesoftware on a computer, the signature could be verified to besure no unauthorized changes (such as the addition of a virus)have been made.  The digital signature could be verifiedperiodically to ensure the integrity of the software.  In database applications, the integrity of information stored inthe database is often essential.  The DSA could be employed in avariety of database applications to provide integrity.  Forexample, information could be signed when it was entered into thedatabase.  To maintain integrity, the system could also requirethat all updates or modifications to the information be signed. Before signed information was viewed by a user, the signaturecould be verified.  If the signature verified correctly, the userwould know the information had not been altered by anunauthorized party.  The system could also include signatures inthe audit information to provide a record of users who modifiedthe information.    These examples show how the DSA can be used in a variety ofapplications to improve the integrity of both data and theapplication.  CSL anticipates that federal agencies willincorporate the DSS into a variety of automated electronicsystems that require message integrity and non-repudiation.Security Provided by the DSSThe security provided by any public key cryptographic systemdepends on several factors.  Some important considerations arethe mathematical soundness of the algorithm, the management ofkeys, and the implementation of the system in an application. The safety of the DSA is dependent on the work needed to find orcompute the discrete logarithm of a very large number. Mathematicians and computer scientists have been working to finda simple solution to the problem of finding logarithms for a longtime.  To date, only incremental improvements in computation havebeen attained through the use of more powerful computers.  It isimportant to understand that an adversary, who does not know theprivate parameters of a party, cannot generate the party'ssignature.  Therefore, a digital signature cannot be forged. Digital signatures offer protection not available by alternativesignature techniques.  One such alternative is a digitizedsignature.  A digitized signature is generated by converting avisual form of a handwritten signature to an electronic image.Although a digitized signature resembles its handwrittencounterpart, it does not provide the same protection as a digitalsignature.  Digitized signatures can be forged.  They can also beduplicated and appended to other electronic data.  Digitizedsignatures cannot be used to determine if information has beenaltered after it is signed.Supporting Functions Functions needed to support the use of the DSS include:  o    The SHS is required to generate a message digest.  A message     digest is a condensed representation of the information to     be signed.  Using the SHS, it is computationally infeasible     to find a message which corresponds to a given message     digest, or to find two different messages which will produce     the same message digest.o    To use the DSS, a party must be able to generate random     numbers to produce the public/private key pair and to     compute the signature.  Random numbers can be generated     either by a true noise hardware randomizer or by using a     pseudorandom number generator.  One approved pseudorandom     number generator is the key generation methodology found in     Appendix C of the ANSI X9.17, "Financial Institution Key     Management (Wholesale)."   o    A means of associating public and private key pairs to the     corresponding users is required.  That is, there must be a     binding of a user's identity and the user's public key.      This binding may be certified by a mutually trusted party.      For example, a certifying authority could sign credentials     containing a user's public key and identity to form a     certificate.  Systems for certifying credentials and     distributing certificates are beyond the scope of the DSS.      NIST plans to develop future guidance on certifying     credentials and distributing certificates.  User, legal, and technical issues related to the establishmentand operation of digital signature infrastructure are beingexplored.  For example, users may require the ability to registertheir public key in a directory or obtain a time/date stamp forlegal documents.  Legal issues such as the liabilities of thecertificate management authority, the admissibility of digitallysigned evidence, and the responsibilities of various federalagencies in supporting the use of the DSS must be examined.  Sometechnical requirements which must be addressed include theinterrelationships among users and user communities necessary forproviding services such as certifying credentials anddistributing certificates; the need to interoperate with privatesector and international certificate authorities; and the need toprovide users with the ability to withdraw or immediately revoketheir public key and provide notification to the appropriatecertificate and directory authorities.NIST expects that this work will harmonize with applicableinternational standards such as CCITT X.400 Recommendations,standards for electronic mail, and CCITT X.500, standards fordirectory services.  As this work progresses, NIST will provideupdates to federal departments and agencies.  Applicability of the DSSWhen approved by the Secretary of Commerce, the DSS will be thegovernmentwide standard for use by all federal agencies includingdefense agencies which require a public key cryptographicsignature system for unclassified information.  In addition, NIST has been informed by Department of Defenseauthorities that the DSS may be used to sign unclassifiedinformation processed by "Warner Amendment" systems (10 U.S.C.2315 and 44 U.S.C. 3502[2]) and classified data in selectedapplications.  The General Accounting Office (GAO) has also issued a decisionregarding the use of electronic signatures to create validcontractual obligations which can be recorded as consistent with31 U.S.C. 1501.  Under Controller General Decision B-245714, theGAO has concluded that "Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systemsusing message authentication codes which follow NIST's ComputerData Authentication Standard (Federal Information ProcessingStandard [FIPS] 113) or digital signatures following NIST'sDigital Signature Standard, as currently proposed, can produce aform of evidence that is acceptable under section 1501." Reference DocumentsProposed FIPS for Digital Signature StandardThis proposed standard specifies a Digital Signature Algorithmappropriate for applications requiring a digital rather than awritten signature.Proposed FIPS for Secure Hash StandardThis proposed standard specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)for use with the proposed Digital Signature Standard. Additionally, for applications not requiring a digital signature,the SHA is to be used whenever a secure hash algorithm isrequired for federal applications.FIPS 46-1, Data Encryption Standard (DES)This standard provides the technical specifications for the DES.FIPS 113, Computer Data AuthenticationThis standard specifies a Data Authentication Algorithm, basedupon the DES, which may be used to detect unauthorizedmodifications to data, both intentional and accidental.
