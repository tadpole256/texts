		 The Macintosh Secret Code-Name List

Please report corrections to me, no matter how insignificant!
You may (of course!) distribute this information freely,
but please keep my name on this list if you pass it around whole.
New info about codenames will be attributed and very much appreciated.

"Code-name" is my term for the names that machines and software get
before they are released with `official' names.  A special subdivision
of Apple has the sole responsibility of naming everything Apple makes,
but until they make up their minds, the developer engineers have to
call their gizmos _something_ while they're working on them...

These names really aren't that important any more, but some of the
names are amusing and interesting, and they might help you think up a
pet name for your new Macintosh.

Macintosh 128k ROMs (in the Plus and below) had chip codes which began
with the letters L and H and were therefore nicknamed appropriately
(for example, "Lonely Hearts"), while the chip codes of the
32-bit-wide CPUs use the letters A, B, C, D ("Ala Baster Can Delabra").

The Apple Developer CD's also have interesting names:
  Volume 1: Phil and Dave's Excellent CD
