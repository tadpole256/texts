If you do have to send it to someone else, hide it     in another message so that only the right recipient will     understand. Many creative methods of hiding messages have been     invented over the ages,. Cryptography in the computer age     typically involves the translation of the original message into a     new and incomprehensible one by a mathematical algorithm using a     specific "key". Just like you need to open the lock on a door with     a key, the algorithm and key protects your the contents of your     message from unauthorized access.     Taking the lock and key model one step further, ease of getting     into the crytographic system depends on the strength of the lock     (the algorithm), and the possession of the key. For example, you     may encrypt your message by changing every letter to the one n     letters later in the alphabet, i.e., A is changed to B, B to C ,     and so on, for n=1. (This method is known as a substitution cipher     and is reputed to have been used by Julius Caesar.) Knowing your     algorithm, it's quite easy to reveal your true message by trying     each of the 25 possible values of the key n.     If we are simply using a trial-and-error approach to discover the     key, the difficulty of breaking the algorithm increases with the     number of possible keys, and with the amount of time it takes to     try each key. However, there may be other approaches that are less     time-consuming. In substitution ciphers, knowlege of the usage     frequency of letters in the language and in the message will     indicate the probable substitutions. As every English-speaking     parent of a child with a "Speak-and-Spell" toy knows, the "e" key     usually wears out first.     The strength of the algorithm should be independent of the     knowledge of how it works. Cryptographers also prefer to trust     published algorithms over proprietary ones because this allows the     community of experts to look for systematic weaknesses. A number     of algorithms that appear impregnable at first have later yielded     to specific techniques of attack. So the longer an algorithm has     remained unbroken, the stronger it is likely to be.     The other part of the equation is the key itself. The longer a key     is in use, the more likely someone will be able to discover it,     and the larger the amount of information that would be     compromised. Changing the key frequently, e.g., on a per message     basis, therefore can strengthen the security of the system.     An introduction to some cipher systems          http://rschp2.anu.edu.au:8080/cipher.html     Lawrie's Cryptography Bibliography          http://mnementh.cs.adfza.oz.au/htbin/bib_lpb     Materials from "Applied Cryptography" by B.

It was developed by IBM and adopted as an     official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 46) in     1976. DES uses a 56-bit key - considered to be just beyond the     technology at the time to break with a brute force approach.     However, by 1993 a custom computer costing $1 million could     theoretically be built to crack DES by brute force in 7 hours. In     the following year, a new technique called "linear cryptanalysis"     enabled another researcher to break DES in 50 days on a single     workstation, or about 14 MIPS-years assuming a 100 MIPS machine.     Efforts to extend the life of DES include lengthening the key to     128 bits (still beyond the realm of computer horsepower today) and     "Triple DES", which involves three passes of encryption and     decryption using two different keys.     The RSA algorithm, used in public key cryptography and patented in     the US, is based on the fact that it's easy to multiply two large     prime numbers together, but hard to factor them out of the     product. A challenge issued in 1977 to factor the key based on a     129 digit number (or 429 bits) was finally met in 1994 by an     international group of over 600 volunteers and 1500 computers     working for 8 months. The estimated effort was somewhere between     100,000 amd 1,000,000 MIPS-years. The decrypted message read, "THE     WORDS ARE SQUEAMISH OSSIFRAGE", starting the tradition of using     those words in key-breaking challenges.     IDEA, International Data Encryption Algorithm, is a new DES-like     algorithm invented in 1991 in Switzerland. It uses a 128-bit key     and was designed with more mathematical theory than DES. It is     believed to be a strong algorithm, but no challenge has yet been     mounted, and only time will tell whether it will withstand the     attacks of cryptographers. IDEA is patented internationally.     RC2 qnd RC4 are two proprietary, DES-like algorithms that allow     variable key lengths. They were developed by RSA Data Security,     Inc, and are notable for having an exportable version with a     limited, 40-bit key size. The 40-bit RC4 algorithm is used in the     International versions of many software packages including the     Netscape web browser. In the last week, a French programmer     successfully broke a 40-bit key and decrypted a single secure     Netscape transaction (created as a challenge using data from a     hypothetical Mr. Cosmic Kumquat at 1234 Squeamish Ossifrage Road).     Netscape estimates that the effort took 64 MIPS-years.     DES          http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html     The Challenge to Decrypt a Secure Netscape Transaction:          http://www.netsurf.com/nsf/v01/03/local/nscpchal.html     RSA FAQ          http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/cryptography-faq/part06/faq.html     RSA in 17 lines of Perl          http://draco.centerline.com:8080/~franl/crypto/rsa-guts.html     The RSA-129 Challenge          ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/math/rsa129/rsa129.ps.gz     Ê     IN ? WE TRUST     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Where do keys come from?     For two people to communicate in encrypted mode, they would have     to arrange the secret key before hand. Setting up keys presents     all sorts of logistical problems when you are communicating with     multiple people (a separate key may be needed for each), or when     you cannot communicate the key information securely in the first     place. Some systems get around this by establishing a centralized     key authority, e.g., the US Government, or the key database in a     Kerberos system. However, the invention of public key cryptography     changed all that. Unlike private key or symmetric encryption where     a single key is used for both encryption and decryption, public     key (or asymmetric) encryption uses a public key-private key pair.     The sender encrypts the message using the published public key,     and the recipient reads the message by decrypting it with the     private key. Public key directories could be published, just like     telephone and other directories. However, the use of public key     directories presents a different problem. Since the key is not     prearranged through a trusted source, how can you be sure the     public key belongs to a real and legitimate person or     organization? All you might have is a disembodied e-mail address     or URL.     There are currently two solutions to the certification issue -     building what is commonly termed a "web of trust", and setting up     official key issuing authorities. The web of trust works through     personal recommendations. Your public key is "signed" by other     people who can vouch for you. If I trust one or more of those     people, I would believe that you are real and legitimate. The     alternative is institutional, through a Certification Authority     (CA). As states issue drivers licences or universities issue ID     cards, public keys can be "issued" by an organization that is     familiar with the individual involved, or Certification     Authorities. These CA's in turn derive their "trust" from     thecentral Internet Registration Policy Authority to form a     hierachical organization.     Public Key Cryptography FAQ          http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/cryptography-faq/part06/faq.html     Key Management          http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_km.html     PGP Public Key Server          http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html     Key Certificate Issuance System          http://www.rsa.com/rsa/prodspec/cis/rsa_cis.htm     Internet Regional Policy Authority (IRPA)          http://bs.mit.edu:8001/ipra.html     Ê     POSTCARDS FROM CYBERSPACE     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Sometimes signed but never sealed     E-mail is arguably the most prevalent and important component of     Internet traffic. We tend to think of mail mostly in terms of     letters in sealed envelops. But mail messages being routed from     computer system to computer system on their journey through the     Internet are more like postcards than letters. Along the way, a     message can be read, and even more, it can be modified. E-mail     headers are notoriously easy to forge. Encrypting the message is     one technique to prevent tampering. In addition, cryptographic     techniques can also be used to securely "sign" a mail message     without encrypting the message..     In signing a document, a one way hash function is used to reduce     the message to a short, fixed length string of characters (a     digest). The digest is then encrypted with the sender's private     key to create a digital signature. To verify the signature, the     recipient takes the message and converts it into digest form, and     separately decrypts the sender's signature with the sender's     public key. The results of these two operations should be     identical if the message has not been tampered with. In addition,     use of the sender's public key to decrypt the signature also     confirms that the message actually came from the sender.     Common one way hash algorithms include MD2, MD4, and MD5 from RSA     Data Systems, and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) invented by the     NSA as part of the US government Digital Signature Standard (DSS).     RSA FAQ on MD2, MD4, and MD5, and Digital Signatures          http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_misc.html     Ê     DIGITAL ENVELOPES     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Sealed with a cipher     Public key algorithms such as RSA are used in mail encryption     programs. However, because of the resources required to encrypt     messages with RSA, only a randomly-generated session key is     usually encrypted with RSA. This session key is used to encrypt     the message with a private key algorithm such as DES. This     approach provides the added advantage that a different key is used     to encrypt each message that is sent.     PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is the best-known secure mail program     available today. It was written by Philip Zimmermann and first     released in 1991. It uses RSA public key cryptography for session     key exchange, and IDEA for message encryption. Because of US     patents surrounding the RSA algorithm and US export regulations,     PGP has had a colourful history. The result is different versions,     not always compatible with each other, available for use within     US/Canada and for the rest of the world.     PEM, the Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard, is developed as an     Internet mail standard by many of the people who helped create     PGP. The standard is described in RFC 1421-1423, and also includes     the X.509 Key Certification Standard from CCITT. Originally, it     only allowed a hierarchical key certification organization,     however this has been modified to include the PGP-styled "web of     trust" model. Reference implementations include RIPEM, Riordan's     Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail developed by Mark Riordan, and a     version from Trusted Information Systems, Inc. RIPEM currently     does not support key certification.     The main difference between PGP and PEM appear to be in the area     of sender privacy. PGP allows encryption without signing, i.e.,     anonymous, encrypted messages, and PEM does not. Additionally, the     PEM message signature is outside the encryption envelop, allowing     anyone to verify the sender of the message without reading the     message.     Recently, RSA Data Security and a number of key messaging vendors     have announced support for a new standard for secure MIME     messaging (S/MIME).     The MIT PGP distribution          http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html     PGP Resource Page          http://draco.centerline.com:8080/~franl/pgp     PGP Outside the US and Canada          http://rschp2.anu.edu.au:8080/crypt.html     An Excellent History of PGP          "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy".

What is often forgotten is that pivotal battles during     World War II, such as the campaign against Rommel in North Africa,     or the Battle of Midway, relied upon intelligence gleaned by     breaking German and Japanese codes. In effect, cryptography played     as important or perhaps even more important role compared with     such plebian materiel as cannons or bombs. Although time has     passed, export of cryptography is strictly regulatd.     But at the same time, the Internet has no natural political     boundaries. PGP, placed on the Net by an enthusiastic user,     quickly spread to the rest of the world. The same happened to RSA     Data Security's RSAREF reference code library. The result is a     federal criminal investigation of Philip Zimmermann. As the     Internet community comes to grips with dealing with export     control, World Wide Web and FTP sites are creating restrictions     and posting advisories to discourage downloading non-Americans.     More dramatic approaches include an effort to excise DES     encryption out of the Kerberos network security system. This bare     bones system would then be exportable and an encryption engine can     be reinstalled abroad.     The software industry is acutely aware of the cost of export     control, and is active in lobbying for its reduction or     elimination. The recent quick breaking of the 40-bit key version     of RC4 used for exportable versions of software has simply served     to emphasize the limitations of existing export controls.     Interestingly enough, although computer code cannot be legally     exported, source code in printed form within a book does not seem     to face the same restrictions. Books containing sample DES     implementations are widely available. Schneier's "Applied     Cryptography" book can be exported, but not the diskette     containing the same source code as is listed in the book. One     might wonder whether this is a face-saving compromise along the     lines of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".     TIS Survey on International Use of DES          http://www.tis.com/Home/crypto/crypto-survey.html     Books containing DES source code in FORTRAN, C, 6502 Assembly, and     Basic          http://www.quadralay.com/www/Crypt/DES/source-books.html     Court Cases in Cryptography and Export Control          http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/export.html     The Philip Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund          http://www.netresponse.com/zldf     Ê     HIDING IN PLAIN VIEW     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Of microdots, the USS Pueblo, and steganography     An encrypted message looks like gibberish, and alert people that     there is something to hide. But what if the message is totally     innocuous looking? This is an old trick that started centuries ago     with writing in ink that is invisible until the paper has been     heated. The microdot, a piece of film containing a very highly     reduced image of the secret message and embedded in the     punctuation marks of a normal document, was invented during World     War II. In the 60's, a photograph of members of the USS Pueblo     released by their captors to show their cooperation seemed     ordinary enough until you looked carefully at the hanf positions.     They were spelling out the word "SNOWJOB" in sign language. And we     all remember the hysteria about finding satanic messages by     playing certain recordings backwards.     What if you used the least significant bit of each pixel in a     bitmap image to encode a message? The impact on the appearance of     the image would not be noticeable. This is known as steganography,     or covered writing. A 480 pixel wide by 100 pixel high image -     smaller than many WWW home page banners, could theoretically     contain a message of more than 5,000 characters. The ecoding is     quite easy with a computer - and no complicated mathematics at     all. And of course the same principles apply to audio and video     files as well. Furthermore, the image can be used simply as a     carrier, with the message being first encrypted. So an old trick     has found a new, digital dog.     Steganography Archives          ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/steganography/     Ê     MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Applied cryptography for a little fun and mostly profit     While mail privacy is an important topic to many, cryptography     also contributes to an area of far greater monetary value: online     commerce. Public key cryptography enables digital signatures that     verify the authenticity of a document, confirms the authorization     of the sender, and non-repudiation of the transaction - all     critical components to financial transactions. It contributes in     other areas as well.     Timing is important to many transactions, e.g., tax returns must     be filed by midnight, April 15, in the US, There needs to be a     secure mechanism to timestamp the corresponding electronic     documents. Surety Technologies provides a Digital Notary System     that produces electronic timestamping. It is based on combining     message digests (created as part of the digital signature process)     and timestamp values from a tamper-proof clock to create "super"     messages that can be uniquely identified. The contents of the     original document need not be revealed to the timestamp service.     Current trends in electronic payment systems is firmly towards the     development of a stored-value card. Money is "downloaded" and     stored in an integrated circuit on the card. This can be for used     for any purchase where cash can be used. Up to this point, cash     has remained the last anonymous, untraceable method of payment.     With the capabilities of a "smart" card such as the stored value     card, all "cash" transaction information would also be captured,     creating an associated loss of privacy. However, we need not lose     our privacy to gain the use of electronic cash. Dr. David Chaum of     Digicash has created algorithms for "blind signatures" that allow     anonymous use of cash through a smart card mechanism. Whether this     will be adopted by major card organizations, though, remains an     open question.     Digital Notary Systems          http://www.surety.com     Visa Announces Smart Card Specification          http://www.visa.com/visa/press_releases/visa_pr5.31.95.a.html     Mastercard and Visa Announces Secure Credit Card Transactions          http://www.mastercard.com/Press/release-950623.htm     Chaum's Article on Blind Signature Technology and Digital Privacy          http://www.digicash.com/publish/sciam.html     Proposed Electronic Payment Systems          http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/Project/proposed.html     Mondex Stored Value Card          http://www.mondex.com/mondex/home.htm     Ê     NO NAMES PLEASE     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Just sign me "a private netizen".     Digital signatures can help confirm that the sender of a message     is really who he says he is, but what happens when he doesn't want     someone to know? Anonymous letters - graffiti, ransom notes,     whistle blowing, etc. have all been around for a long time and     often serve a genuine purpose. Yet e-mail systems generally     persist in recording and reporting information about the message     originator. To preserve the anonymity of the sender, "anonymous     remailers" have been set up on the Internet. Messages sent to     these remailers for forwarding have the originating header     stripped off and replaced with the address of the remailer.     Replies to the remailer are then forwarded back to the originator     without revealing his identity. While, the best known of anonymous     remailers is Although most people think of anon.penet.fi, run by     Penetic, a company in Finland, there are actually about 20     remailers on the Internet     In using an anonymous remailer, one must always remember that the     remailer is but one part of the system, and that it too is subject     to attacks. First of all, your mail may go through a number of     hops before reaching the remailer. Mail can be monitored en route,     and especially at the point of origin. Even if your message is     encrypted, the knowlege that you are sending mail to an anonymous     remailer may be cause for suspicion. Traffic analysis of the     remailer - tracking incoming and outgoing mail and their sizes,     can review the identity of seemingly anonymous messages. There is     a variety of techniques to improve the certainty of anonymity and     to defend remailers from attacks; e.g., by chaining - sending a     message through a number of remailers to the final destination, or     by holding mail a random amount of time to deter traffic analysis.     However, not all attacks are technical. In February, the Church of     Scientology was able to obtain the identity of one user of     anon.penet.fi by a criminal complaint throu gh Interpol and the     Finnish police authorities. Protecting privacy is a step removed     from shielding criminal activity.     Remailer FAQ          http://www.well.com/user/abacard/zremail.html     Remailers Resource Page          http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html     Breaking the Anonymity of anon.penet.fi          http://www.clas.ufl.edu/~avi/NII/TIME_penet.txt          http://www.tezcat.com/~wednsday/penet.pr     How to Secure Remailers Against Attacks          http://obscura.com/~loki/remailer-essay.html     Ê     BIG BROTHER, BIG IRON     ------------------------------------------------------------------     The gusher from the data strata     During the 1972 US Presidential Elections, the McGovern campaign     found that one of its best sources of campaign contributions came     from a list of Volvo owners. The discovery was serendipitous, but     in the intervening years, computer technology has grown to the     point of playing a vital role in identifying these kinds of trends     and patterns. And increasing computerization means that far more     information is being kept in electronic databases amenabale to     efficient searches and correlations. Database marketing, or     database drilling, is now a standard part of the marketer's     repertoire. It has plenty of data to work on, from credit card     transactions to subscriptions and mailing lists, and even the     government gets in the act by selling information such as name,     address, and driver's license number.     At the same time, the ability to link information in different     databases - education and driving records, credit history, health,     spending patterns, etc. - is no further away than a unique ID     number. Most countries have some form of ID system for its     citizens; the US has the social security number (SSN). Although     the SSN was explicitly intended not to be a national ID number,     practically it is used by many organizations for idenification     purposes. The result of even partial linking of records would be     an incredibly detailed history of our lives - after all, it's a     mere matter of programming, and not complicated programming at     that.     Data Mining with Equipment from SGI          http://www.sgi.com/Products/hardware/challenge/Datamining/mining0.html     Information about Social Security Numbers          ftp://cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/ssn/html/SSN-FAQ.html     Ê     IT'S B-A-A-A-CK!     ------------------------------------------------------------------     Clipper sightings on the Internet sea     Despite the mountains of data that accumulate about our highly     computerised lives, the ability to (get a court order) and listen     in to the conversations of Americans has always been a cherished     tool by law enforcement agencies. The rise of digital telephony     and telecommunications and cryptography threatened to put an end     to that. The government's response was to propose the Capstone     program. The key piece was the Clipper chip. Incorporated into all     telephones and other such devices, this would permit encrypted     communications through the use of the "Skipjack" algorithm. Except     the device is built with a "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF).     Given a court order, the law enforcement agency could go to key     escroll centers with the field information and obtain the keys     necessary to decrypt the conversation.     The outcry from this announcement was loud and long. The Skipjack     algorithm. classified and implemented in hardware, did not allow     the cryptographic community to examine and test its strength.     Worse, many were afraid that the algorithm contained a trapdoor     that would allow decryption without the escrolled keys. Others     thought that Clipper marked the beginnings of an attempt to outlaw     cryptography. The irony was that upon closer examination, Dr. Matt     Blaze of Bell Labs discovered a way to create a bogus LEAF and     thus make decryption by the authorities impossible.     With that, the Clipper chip subsided into oblivion. However, in     the last week, the Clinton Administration has indicated that it     will soon propose a "son of Clipper" - and hinted at allowing     non-government escroll centers. In the interval, the programming     community had not been idle. Nautilus, an encrypted phone system     running on PC's and communicating through the Internet was     introduced in the spring. (The name Nautilus comes from the     submarine that sank clipper ships in the Jules Verne classic     "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea".) Philip Zimmermann has just     announced PGPFone, a similar system running on Macintoshes.     CPSR Clipper Archives          ftp://cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper/     WWW Virtual Library on Clipper          http://draco.centerline.com:8080/~franl/clipper/about-clipper.html     Source for Nautilus          ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/nautilus/     Nautilus Developers          mailto:nautilus@lila.com          Colorado Catacombs BBS - 303/772-1062     PGPFone (will be uploaded when available)          ftp://net-dist.mit.edu     Ê     'BOTS, AGENTS, AND WIZARDS     ------------------------------------------------------------------     It's eleven o'clock at night. Do you know what your software is     doing?     First came the programs that helped us to write letters and     spreadsheets on our personal computers. Then came the insidious     little viruses - hiding inside other programs that did everything     from wishing us "Have a nice day" to wiping out our hard drives.     Well, whatever they did, they stayed within the confines of our     computers. Then we got online services - our PC's started to     communicate with the service mainframe at the other end of the     phone line in a client-server fashion. And the client sometimes     served the server...     As much as the client software can help you send mail and download     interesting information from the server, it is just another     program that has control over your computer and its resources.     There are the usual urban legends about client software from major     online services that rearranged the PC's file system - and some of     this naturally happens when you download and install a software     upgrade. What is less amusing is the report of a Registration     Wizard within beta versions of Microsoft's Windows 95 system. This     program gathers information about all the software that is being     run on all the PC's in your network and then reports it to     Microsoft when the you signs up for Microsoft Network Services.     Performance monitoring has been around for many companies,     particularly in service organizations, e.g., the speed of the     cashiers at busy supermarkets, or of directory assistance     operators. As we depend more and more on personal computers and     get increasingly interconnected, the potential for information     gathering and reporting to outsiders rises. The early adopters are     likely those online services who provide the communication link,     since they can directly upload the information gathered. But what     prevents another program from sending information via e-mail to     its originators if the communication is possible? Visionaries     speak of the much heralded "intelligent agent" technologies from     the likes of General Magic. These would wander the net searching     for information, purchasing hardware and software, making friends     and influencing other agents. Given the above discussion, the     possibilities for mischief - if unchecked - is mind-boggling.     Microsoft Registration Wizard:          Information Week report (available by searching)               http://techweb.cmp.com/techweb          Unauthorized Windows 95's Detailed Analysis               ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/windows/win95.update/regwiz.html     General Magic's Agent Technology          http://www.genmagic.com/about-magic.html     Ê     INFORMATION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS     ------------------------------------------------------------------     The educated person knows where to find the information     The issues of privacy and cryptography are of vital interest to     many of the denizens of the Internet.
